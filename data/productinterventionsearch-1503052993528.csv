I designed a high throughput screen for inhibitors of ligand binding by serum amyloid P component and, in collaboration with Roche, 100,000 compounds in their library were screened. The best lead was developed into a drug which was eventually licensed exclusively to myself and UCL for clinical testing in humans. I discovered that it had a completely novel pharmacological mechanism of action which caused rapid and almost total depletion of circulating serum amyloid P component. This was reported in Nature in 2002 and received major coverage in the scientific and lay media, including mainstream BBC, ITV, US and European television and radio. It was identified by the American Chemical Society as one of the medicinal chemistry highlights of 2002. My invention of the mechanism responsible is covered by granted patents.","Our first into man open label phase 2 study in systemic amyloidosis showed promising signs of clinical efficacy. Our open label first clinical study in Alzheimer's disease showed complete safety and dramatic biochemical efficacy in depleting SAP from the CSF. We have now out licensed CPHPC to GSK as part of the package for treatment of systemic amyloidosis by my newly invented approach detailed separately. Other workers have used my approach to design drugs targeting cholera and shiga toxins, while I have used it to design successfully the first inhibitor of human C-reactive protein, as reported in another entry in this form. The same strategy also led to our novel drugs targeting transthyretin for treatment and prevention of transthyretin amyloidosis.","http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01406314","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=A6F883044CC&grantRef=G7900510","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G7900510","FA4479B9-FFED-4BD0-9294-CA32EEAC4047","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","72A324FF-B975-443D-BDD8-19E9649401E7"

Although transplantation is the best treatment for kidney failure, most transplants do not survive for the recipient's natural lifespan, but instead fail after 10-12 years. Damage by the immune system, called 'chronic rejection' accounts for 50% of failing transplants and it is now possible to identify patients at risk by screening for 'HLA antibodies' in the blood. This application is to test a screening and treatment protocol for antibodies in a randomised controlled trial. Those with antibodies will be randomised into biomarker-led (BLC) or standard care (SC) groups. In the former, test results are revealed and recruits will have their anti-rejection drugs changed to a regime of prednisone, tacrolimus and MMF, each already licensed for use in transplant recipients. We have evidence that this regime is effective at preventing graft dysfunction and expect this to feed through to improvements in survival. In the SC group, screening results are double blinded and recruits will remain on their current therapies. In those without antibodies, recruits will be randomised to either blinded or unblinded screening and remain on standard treatment. Testing will continue every 8 months; recruits in the unblinded screening group will move into the BLC group if they become antibody positive. The primary outcome is kidney failure rates within 3 years of randomisation in HLA antibody+ recruits, predicted to be approximately 20% in the SC but &lt;10% in the BLC groups. Secondary outcomes include rates of deterioration, the incidence of infections, cancers and diabetes, an analysis of the role of non-adherence with medication, and a scientific study to identify new biomarkers associated with outcomes. A cost analysis will confirm whether the screening programme and treatment protocol can save money by keeping kidney transplants functioning for longer.

In the training condition, the 'correct' classification shifted two morph steps towards 'happy'; the two images nearest the balance point that the participant would have previously classified as 'angry' at baseline were considered 'happy' in terms of providing feedback.","None yet.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=biWCrVwCrEa&grantRef=MR%2FJ011819%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/J011819/1","3E7F5919-642A-4328-846B-2F28672FEDD0","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","9E1E0B3C-8459-4367-B9F6-C6B4E911AC83"

Zebrafish is an ideal vertebrate model system for target validation and inhibitor screening where the aetiology and pathogenesis of cancer in zebrafish mirrors that in mammals. We wish to demonstrate that our zebrafish melanoma model can be used for target validation and as a drug-discovery tool using PAK4 as a proof of principle. Our model is published and validated as representative of human disease and has an advantage over previous zebrafish models because aberrant melanocyte proliferation occurs at an early larval stages which makes it amenable to high through put analysis. Tumour growth can be monitored by quantification of melanin expression and the fluorescently labelled tumour cells can be imaged in real time. We are seeking funds to strengthen our DPFS full proposal by 1. Generating a V12Ras vector with a commercially acceptable Green flourescent protein (GFP). We can then use this vector to establish a new zebrafish line at KCL as soon as we have full funding - this will significantly advance the project 2. Develop quantitative high-through-put analysis protocols for tumour growth and invasive behaviour - this will strengthen the unique aspects of the project proposal. 3. Identify siRNA sequences to knockdown zebrafish PAK4 - this will progress the proof of concept element of our proposal.

It is characterised by multiple benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours (neurofibromas). Affected individuals have a 7%-13% life-time risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) that ususally arise from benign plexiform neurofibromas. MPNST are challenging to diagnose and treat, frequently heralding a poor prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows the site and extent of the tumour but is not a reliable indicator of malignancy. [18]-F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computerised tomography (FDG PET-CT) has enabled the selection of patients likely to have MPNST by virtue of the increased metabolic activity of the tumours, but demonstrates an overlap between benign and malignant tumours, necessitating potentially hazardous diagnostic surgery. Sensitive and specific diagnostic imaging is essential to predict MPNST grade and prognosis and to permit monitoring of response to drug therapy. [11]C- methionine PET (MET PET) will be evaluated as a diagnostic tool for NF1-MPNSTs to determine its' superiority to FDG PET. MET and FDG PET findings will be compared with tumour histology (microscopic structure) to determine its ability to predict tumour grade and prognosis.

This antibody blocks the interaction of E2 with CD81, a cellular receptor essential for virus entry. It also neutralizes infection of cells with diverse viral genotypes and subtypes. Given its broadly neutralizing properties, MAb AP33 was humanized in collaboration with the MRCT Therapeutic Antibody Group. The latter is currently being considered for clinical trials in HCV-infected liver transplant recipients.","The humanised MAb AP33, called MRCT10, is expected to be of direct clinical benefit for passive immunotherapy to reduce the risk of HCV infection after needlestick or other accidental exposure, and in the liver-transplant setting to reduce the incidence of graft re-infection.

This programme will generate a library of antibiotic conjugates engineered for use in distinct human disease processes where Gram-negative antimicrobial resistance represents a major clinical challenge (cystic fibrosis and skin wounds). The conjugates will be optimised in a series of in vitro studies (including physicochemical characterisation and microbiological assays). The delivery system offers the opportunity to effectively target the antibiotic, which, following systemic administration, selectively accumulates at sites of inflammation and infection. This phenomenon effectively reduces the toxicity and increases the bioavailability of the antibacterial peptide. Seedcorn funding will develop and characterise these antibiotic conjugates to enhance the IP potential of the research prior to clinical testing and full-scale commercial development.

The project is based on the integration of new developments in mechanical sensor production and detection, where several of our own innovations in nanosensor instrumentation combined with recent research will facilitate optimization of the nanosensors for applications in liquids to the level necessary that even detection of prion infection in blood samples seems to be achievable. The goal of the project is to develop a proof-of-concept device that can be taken to a product that provides a new rapid diagnostic tool at the point of care.

Optimal sensors will then be produced by injection moulding methods and confirmed to retain their high performance.

We have shown that sequestration of NGF abrogates pain in many conditions. Antagonism of the NGF/TrkA (tyrosine kinase receptor A) interaction will have similar benefits, and we have identified and validated the NGF binding domain of TrkA (TrkAIg2) as a target. We identified different classes of TrkA antagonists in silico; which have been confirmed in vitro. One compound was used for the rational design and synthesis of a series of low molecular weight, high affinity compounds. We have identified residues on the isolated TrkAIg2 which interact with compounds tested using protein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Our established interdisciplinary team has expertise in biochemistry, NMR, molecular modelling, synthetic chemistry and in vivo validation. We plan to develop these compounds further towards entry into clinical trials as moderators of intractable pain states such as osteoarthritis and post-operative pain

The question raised is whether the hypertension caused this narrowing or whether the narrowing (and reduced blood flow) caused the hypertension. In a hypertensive animal model, this re-modelling was also found but, interestingly, occurred before the hypertension. This supports our hypothesis that stenosed vertebral arteries, and subsequent poor perfusion of the brainstem, is a cause for hypertension. We wish to: (i) confirm the observations in living hypertensive man that there is a narrowing of cerebral vessels using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and, (ii) assess the prevalence of this condition and (iii) establish whether antihypertensive medication reverses cerebral artery stenosis. This study may have prognostic value and provide improved treatment regimes for hypertension, which is an escalating health issue since the numbers of those becoming resistant to drug treatment is ~25%.

Its importance and high profitability potential is highlighted in BCC Research market research reports (2014) according to which: &quot;The global market for induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was estimated to total $853 million in 2012, and close to $1.2 billion in 2013, averaging 40% growth. 
Our novel technology currently fills in a gap in the market and offers a greatly profitable marketing opportunity in this rapidly-expanding and extremely popular science field. So far, the iPS cells generation process is often long and laborious including many steps. It is also inconvenient to the donor of somatic cells. The cells produced may also contain viral-driven mutations. In contrast, our kit and protocol offers a reduction in the steps needed in the generation. It is also safer, faster and more reproducible. It will make &quot;disease-in-a-dish&quot; a faster and highly efficient approach in any lab around the world using an extremely small volume of blood. 
The market of iPS cells is expected to reach $2.9 billion in 2018, an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.7% for the five-year period 2013 to 2018.&quot; This trend is bound to continue increasing and expanding and our novel technology is predicted to have an enormous impact on this. 
In summary, our novel protocol and novel kit concept has the following advantages over other similar products in the market.
1. Protocol novelty: Very small volume of sample, very short time iPS cell generation time with high efficiency, safer cell reprogramming, more cost-effective, and suitable for both healthy donors and diabetic patients.
2. Kit novelty: Simplified gene delivery transfection method using a specific kit component never before used in the market for the generation of iPS cells (or cell reprogramming in general). 
We are in Initial stages of developing and optimising our method, our next step is to seek support for further developing this product and bringing to the market in the foreseeable future.","The patient-specific cells which could be generated based on our novel method have the potential to differentiate towards any cell type in the body (such as vascular cells, cardiac cells, kidney cells, neurons, b-cells etc..). Therefore the potential of this novel technology for regenerative medicine is enormous.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=56e02e7bb82185.70430960&grantRef=BB%2FM003221%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/M003221/1","8CA157EA-FA20-4E8F-B29B-7442BEB5F635","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","EC23DA53-CA73-4104-A3F6-2A9523484E69","E3FF5C55-70A6-437D-801D-5A268EA1C002"

A full-size testing rig was
constructed alongside an appearance model. The clinical team defined protocols for consistent, measurable clinical evaluation. Three separate evaluation sessions measured specific outcomes throughout the study:
1. A potential to achieve fewer healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs), measured by a reduction in contamination incidents during scenario-based testing.
2. Fewer adverse incidents and equipment failures, measured by a reduction in treatment time and mitigated clinical incidents during scenario-based testing.
3. Improved patient experience - measured by increased patient ratings. 
The evaluations have demonstrated a reduction in time taken to complete certain treatment stages by 37%–50%. Cross-contamination infection instances within the treatment space were reduced by 69%. A 10% improvement in staff Technical Skills scores through better ergonomics was recorded.

Modest additional funding has been gained from the EC Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme (H2020-ICT-2014-1 call).

Transcutaneous oestrogen avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism and therefore is not expected to be associated with the same level of cardiovascular (CVS) system toxicity as oral oestrogen. 

The primary outcome measures will be overall survival and progression-free survival. The secondary outcome measures include prostate cancer specific survival, hormone levels, CVS and other toxicity, and quality of life. 

Data from the trial so far have shown promising evidence of the safety and efficacy of the oestrogen patches. Results from the first stage of the trial which aimed to assess the safety and activity of the patches have been published (n= 254), showing the patches produced castrate levels of testosterone similar to LHRHa, with no evidence of excess CVS toxicity. During the second stage, a pre-planned interim analysis (n=638) reviewed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee in June 2013 led to the trial being extended for a phase III evaluation of the patch efficacy.

For a summary of a systematic review on the use of parenteral oestrogens in prostate cancer undertaken to inform the design of this study please see Appendix H or access the following link: http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/pdf/parentoestrogen.pdf).","Results from a bone health sub-study embedded within PATCH have shown transdermal oestrogen protects against the bone mineral density loss seen with LHRHa. However, the clinical efficacy of the patches needs confirming within a phase III trial setting before they can be considered as part of standard care in prostate cancer.","http://www.tevauk.com/mediafile/id/7480.pdf","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=s4Uazf3Bh59&grantRef=MC_U122861330","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_U122861330","300CC796-59A4-412C-85C9-AA8774AE9814","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","666A7C6D-E59C-4C37-8997-490B93914C41","1FFD79A0-0681-4141-A504-FDE130EF7F33"

HSN is a debilitating, neurological disorder in which the sufferer fails to perceive stimuli on one side of space. Common symptoms involve failing to notice people on the affected side, becoming lost, bumping into objects, and failing to groom or wash parts of the body. The condition is estimated to affect one half of all stroke survivors, and is the strongest predictor of long-term disability post-stroke, significantly prolonging length of inpatient stay and increasing the need for assisted living after discharge. The established method of diagnosing HSN is the Behavioural Inattention Test, a paper and pencil test. Unfortunately, this is time-consuming, requires technical expertise to administer, is open to subjective interpretation, and must be conducted within a dedicated quiet room. Clinicians and hospital managers tell us that a quicker and cheaper means of diagnosis is needed that can be more easily integrated into standard, routine assessment. Our proposed Apple iPad application will meet this need. A working prototype has already been constructed and is now ready to undergo clinical validation.","still under validation",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=545b6d52283b43.65405173&grantRef=G1001222","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G1001222","4EEC44D6-9572-42C2-9695-8A181096D87C","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","C6D0044A-2CD2-4167-B90B-922AF53E361F","5477EF71-9B1A-484C-A7BF-F121DA220943"

ARDS occurs in response to many different illnesses including severe trauma, infection and major surgery, and affects all age groups. In ARDS the lungs becomes leaky, and fill with fluid so it becomes difficult to breathe. Patients are put on &quot;ventilators&quot;. There is no known specific drug treatment to treat ARDS that improves outcome.
(b) Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can reduce inflammation, fight infection and improve repair of injured tissue. In experimental models of ARDS MSCs can improve lung function and fight infection. MSCs have been given safely to patients with a range of other diseases. In this proposal we want to test MSCs in patients with ARDS. We will use a highly purified population of MSCs derived from umbilical cords.
(c) We will assess safety of MSC administration to patients with ARDS, and whether they improve severity of illness. We will study blood, lung fluid and urine from patients with ARDS to identify how MSCs provide their beneficial effect. This may give important information about how MSCs work which may allow further optimization for future use.","If MSCs were effective in this small clinical trial we would proceed to a large trial across the UK to confirm the effect.

Training programmes were demonstrated to provide remediation for some children suffering from processing deficits, but currently available commercial programmes are based on incomplete data and are not necessarily optimised for outcome.

A liquid that restores the naturally occurring gas (Nitric Oxide) to prevent pneumonia in patients on breathing machines: A study to find the best dose'. We have developed a new system that generates and delivers nitric oxide and other oxides of nitrogen (NO/NOx) to the stomach and oral cavity of mechanically ventilated patients. We hypothesise that the use of this solution to decontaminate the mouth, upper throat and stomach will significantly reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in mechanically ventilated patients. During critical illness, production of NO is markedly reduced in the digestive tract. This deficiency predisposes to bacterial overgrowth of the stomach and oral cavity and the subsequent development of VAP following unwanted inhalation of infected secretions. The NO generating solution is designed to restore normal levels of NOx in the oral cavity and stomach. The objective of this therapy is to reduce the incidence of VAP and the associated prolonged length of stay, morbidity, mortality and treatment costs.","Other","http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=15334","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=56dee238eaa193.55143268&grantRef=MR%2FJ011134%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/J011134/1","1855ECEA-F12D-4F6C-81CC-83BFF1DCA95D","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","88BFEA76-EA0B-4243-BF93-412228049163"

Meta-analyses of individual patient data from randomized trials evaluating cardiovascular (CV) effects of aspirin show reduced metastases and cancer deaths for those on aspirin. Toxicity concerns have limited aspirin use as a primary anti-cancer prevention agent. In the adjuvant setting, the risk:benefit ratio differs, with higher morbidity and mortality from recurrence potentially outweighing risks. Aspirin, an inexpensive drug with a potential therapeutic role in several common cancers, could have a large impact on the global cancer burden. The Add-Aspirin trial investigates if aspirin use after curative treatment for non-metastatic solid tumours prevents recurrence and prolongs survival. Methods: Add-Aspirin is a double blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, international trial. Eligible participants (n=9,920) from the UK and India will have had potentially curative treatment for non-metastatic cancer. There are 4 separate tumour cohorts - breast (BC), colorectal (CRC), gastro-oesophageal (GOC) and prostate cancer (PC). Following an 8 week active run-in period of aspirin 100mg daily to assess adherence and tolerability, participants are randomised to aspirin 100mg, 300mg or placebo daily for &gt; 5 years.

Secondary outcome measures include adherence, toxicity and CV events. OS across the 4 cohorts is a co-primary outcome measure. Sub-studies include assessment of thromboxane B2 for compliance and methodological work to assess the utility of long-term passive follow up.

Our research focuses on developing pharmacological strategies to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), the main contributor to early graft failure. Our aim is improve the function and longevity of transplanted organs by administering a single dose of an agent to a multi-organ donor prior to organ retrieval. This would prime protective cellular mechanisms in anticipation of the injurious nature of ischemia, cold storage and reperfusion. We are investigating a number of candidate compounds at the molecular level and are studying the most promising in a mouse model of renal IRI. For instance, using heat shock protein 90-binding agents (HBA), we have demonstrated upregulation of protective heat shock proteins in the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys and shown a functional and morpholgical renal protection. We are now in a position to extend our research portfolio and examine these agents in a phase 1 trial.

This product has been the subject of a 3 year public-private partnership between the company, LSHTM, the Bill and Melinda Gate (BMG) Foundation and the Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC). Microencapsulation greatly extends the compound's residual life when applied to interior walls and ceilings. Evaluation by LSHTM in experimental huts in Tanzania showed residual activity of more than a year. Parallel trials in Benin against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes killed more than 80% of An. gambiae for up to 10 months, which is an unprecedented level of effectiveness. Other products tested at the same time included bendiocarb, the carbamate used in our last cluster randomised trial in Muleba, and lambdacyhalothrin, the pyrethroid used by PMI for IRS in Muleba during the previous 5 years.

The test enables these Pt-DNA adducts to be measured at 1 adduct in 2 x 106 base pairs on as little as 10 ?g DNA. The pilot clinical trial has demonstrated that the test can be applied to patients undergoing chemotherapy and that the data may eventually be used as a basis for dose modification to improve efficacy and/or reduce toxicity. Futher development has enabled the distribution of the drug in the major cellular compartments to be quantified and the effect of combination therapies, such as FOLFOX, to be studied.

Phase I clinical trials of the RSV vaccine have been undertaken","Phase I clinical trials, funded by Okarios and GSK, of the novel RSV vaccine have been undertaken and the vaccine was shown to be safe and immunogenic in adults. RSV is a major cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants, affecting ~64 million children annually, worldwide. In the UK, 2 to 3% of infants &lt;1 year of age are hospitalised each year due to RSV. Children who experience RSV disease early in life run a high risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma. Although nearly all children are infected with RSV by 2 years of age, immunity following natural infection is incomplete and re-infections are common. The economic impact of RSV in adults and burden of disease in the elderly are comparable to or greater than that of seasonal influenza. There is no effective RSV vaccine or anti-viral therapy, apart from antibody prophylaxis for high risk individuals. An effective RSV vaccine is needed that can be deployed in infants to induce protection against lower respiratory tract disease, and which can be used to boost immunity in adults and the elderly.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=mwLm1uc4ruM&grantRef=BBS%2FE%2FI%2F00001632","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BBS/E/I/00001632","BC35C765-01D4-4AEF-861E-0A69C49254F8","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","59EE6C94-CB2C-4AB3-9A0B-EAAF5A6550CD","5DC8742C-F283-44E9-9393-25DE98BDE551"

b.) A discharge-planning checklist: for better discharge organisation and patient-centred communication. 
c.) Training for clinicians and managers: a 1.5 day training event to improve knowledge, attitude, skills and motivation for handover and improved information written in the booklet and discharge checklist. 
d.) Establish hospital leadership and state Department of Health endorsement: introduction of programme champions, reminder systems, non-monitory incentives, patient-safety/handover groups, and monitoring to ensure uptake of behaviour change by healthcare workers. 
e.) Education for patients/carers: utilising a range of means (e.g. during clinician consultation, in clinic waiting rooms and through posters/range of community-based activities).

Mutations in ABCA4 are the commonest cause of recessively inherited retinal degenerations and usually present in childhood. Although gene therapy with AAV vectors has been shown to be safe and effective at photoreceptor gene replacement, the ABCA4 coding sequence at 6.7 KB is known to be too large to be packaged effectively into standard AAV vectors. We have recently developed an AAV transgene sequence which includes the full length ABCA4 and various regulatory elements to enhance gene expression.

The aim of this booklet is aimed to be useful for the following reasons:
1. Persistent pain is a major problem in older age, causing distress and disability.
2. Many people have found tat there are things they can do to help themselves to cope with their pain, and to move on with their life.
3. Learning more about pain, how it affects you, and finding out tings you can do to help yourself are important parts of being able to manage your pain.
This booklet provides an introduction to the internet, sources of information , a brief introduction to self-management and a directory of useful organisations. Everyone has their own questions about what they can do to best manage living with chronic pain and this booklet is designed to provide a resource list.","This booklet had been endorsed by the British Pain Society and Pain Association Scotland .This is also been evaluated with pain clinicians and service users throughout the UK","http://www.painassociation.com","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=LGKgSW7GLFy&grantRef=G0900684","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0900684","56816545-6C94-4267-BD22-B46B4E7A8D9C","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","90051600-6EF2-4093-BA8C-2B4B6F550895","53865FFF-1724-47F3-AEEC-C15805AB3FD6"

The aim is to perform a phase-II, placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized clinical trial using low-dose IL-2 to halt ALS disease progression. It will also test the proof of concept that biomarkers can accelerate future intervention studies and provide unique insights on ALS disease pathogenesis, identifying novel target for intervention. The project is coordinated by the hospital of Nimes (France) and involves 11 partners across Europe, a patient's organisation, two CROs for the trial monitoring and biobanking, and a tech transfer company for the EU management. The participating clinical centres are being identified and included in MIROCALS during the course of the project.

The results of ICON 7 along with an American trial (GOG 0218) led to the EMA approval of the drug as first-line treatment in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for advanced ovarian cancer.","ICON7 has shown that bevacizumab improves progression-free survival in women with ovarian cancer. It was also found that patients at high risk of disease progression benefit the most from bevacizumab with respect to both PFS and OS. The results can be found in the NEJM, 2011, volume 365, pages 2484-96
OS results have been recently presented at two conferences. In the randomised population, bevacizumab in conjunction with carboplatin and paclitaxel did not improve survival by a clinically important magnitude. However, in a pre-specified subgroup of women at high risk of progression, a benefit of 4.8 months in the restricted mean survival time is observed.","http://www.icon7trial.org/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=sHyoMeauwfL&grantRef=MC_U122861379","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_U122861379","F79F26AF-036F-427A-9C8A-90818A94FA32","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","666A7C6D-E59C-4C37-8997-490B93914C41","1FFD79A0-0681-4141-A504-FDE130EF7F33"

Most patients respond well to firstline treatment, surgery and chemotherapy, but the majority go on to develop relapsed disease and the 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced disease is only 30%. There is a significant need to develop more effective firstline treatments. 

Standard firstline chemotherapy is a combination of two drugs: carboplatin and paclitaxel, given once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. However, giving these agents weekly may be more effective; this is called dose-fractionated chemotherapy. In ICON8 two dose-fractionated chemotherapy regimens are compared with standard carboplatin-paclitaxel. 

The main outcome measures are whether dose-fractionated chemotherapy extends the time until ovarian cancer relapses (improved progression-free survival) and whether women who receive it live longer (improved overall survival). Secondary outcome measures are comparative toxicity, impact on quality of life and costeffectiveness. 
Women with newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancers are eligible; including those with highrisk early stage (FIGO IC/IIA) or advanced (FIGO IIBIV) cancers. They can enter the trial either following primary surgery or with a plan to undergo delayed primary surgery between the 3rd and 4th cycles of chemotherapy. Women will be randomised to receive either: standard chemotherapy; or carboplatin given 3-weekly with weekly paclitaxel; or both carboplatin and paclitaxel weekly. Treatment duration in all three arms is 18 weeks. 

The trial is currently recruiting patients (recruitment is on schedule with 866/1485 patients recruited). The 1st stage analysis investigating feasibility and safety has been completed. Principle funding is from Cancer Research UK (CRUK trial no. CRUK/10/030).","1.

Delirium is associated with multiple adverse outcomes, and is extremely expensive: the 1-year economic burden in the USA was recently estimated at between $38BN and $152BN. Despite its clear importance, delirium is grossly underdiagnosed: around 50% of cases go undetected. A fundamental cause of this is that diagnosis depends on subjective rating scales, which have inadequate sensitivity, specificity and inter-rater reliability. Therefore, better tests for delirium are urgently required. We have recently built and piloted a new neuropsychological instrument for the objective diagnosis of delirium. It shows excellent sensitivity for inattention and discriminates between delirium and dementia. Here we propose to develop this instrument by building a second prototype and validating this in larger clinical populations. A validated instrument would have wide potential clinical and research utility.

BCNAs, designed and developed in Cardiff have entered clinical trial for shingles. Structural modification to generate dideoxy BCNA (ddBCNA) analogues leads to a loss of anti-VZV activity but the surprising introduction of selective activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The early lead compounds cf1821 and cf2095 are equi-active with the established HCMV drug ganciclovir. We have found novel L-enantiomers of these agents (cf2642) have enhanced antiviral activity against vaccinia virus, showing a potential for treatment of (small)poxvirus infections. These compounds appear to act via a novel mechanism, at viral entry, and share no cross-resistance with current agents. Given the unmet medical need of HCMV, the bioterror interests in (small)pox, and novelty of new compounds they represent new and promising leads for drug discovery. We will use our virology expertise to further optimize the lead compounds for antiviral activity, taking advantage of their UV fluorescence to track their cell entry.

To tackle some of their inherant problems (e.g. poor stability, short shelf-life, antigenic side-effects and poor pharmacokinetics), protein therapuetics are routinely derivatised posttranslationally with chemical entities such a polyethylene glycol (PEG). The drawback of PEGylation is that its effects on protein function are unpredictable. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that introduction of the PEG molecule on the protein is typically performed at a protein terminus or randomly on the protein surface. To address these issues, a novel proprietary protein mutagenesis tool will be used together with an expanded genetic code to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins at defined positions during cellular protein synthesis. The new chemistry inherent in the unnatural amino acid will allow protein modification by PEG at a specific position in a defined way so that both stability and bioactivity are maximised.

Such over-impulsivity results in serious consequences for patients including pathological gambling and even suicide. Seemingly similar impulsive behaviour across patients may be caused by diverse neuropathology, requiring different treatments. Currently clinicians rely on questionnaires and clinical interview to identify impulsivity and the neurobiological basis of the behaviour is not addressed. For development of targeted treatment, one must first have a tool that both accurately characterises the cognitive subsystem damaged and quantifies the degree of impairment. Currently no such objective test exists. We plan to develop a computerised cognitive task as a tool for measuring and characterising impulsivity in patients. Such a tool could be applied to treatment trials and during clinical assessment.

The incidence of osteoarthritis (OA) is more prevalent in our ageing and increasingly obese population (1); current therapeutic strategies provide some pain relief, but adverse side effects make these less than desirable for chronic conditions. Identifying other potential pharmaceutical agents which can alleviate the symptoms associated with OA, whilst remaining efficacious and non-toxic, is an ongoing pursuit. Previously, we have demonstrated that treatment of cytokine-stimulated cartilage explants with Boswellia frereana - a novel Frankincence species, inhibited breakdown of the collagenous matrix, reduced MMP levels and significantly reduced nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2 and cycloxygenase-2 production. Epi-lupeol was identified as the principal constituent of B. frereana.

The intervention aims to develop informal networks that engage women in social contacts, and link them with appropriate mental health treatment. It is provided by two group facilitators as a stand alone intervention, and in collaboration with the primary care physicians when combined with antidepressant use. The social group intervention involves recruitment into a women's group held at a local Pakistani Community Centre. Ten women are invited to join each group for ten weekly sessions by two group facilitators. Group activities are developed in consultation with the ethnic mental health voluntary organisations and informed by focus groups. At the introductory session, the participants choose from a list of indoor and outside activities for subsequent sessions. A psycho-education session provides information about depression including its nature, symptoms, causes and treatment. Great attention is paid to ensuring the intervention is culturally acceptable: participants are collected by taxi accompanied by a female transport facilitator; groups take place in a culturally acceptable venue for Pakistani women; women are addressed and greeted in a culturally appropriate way by group facilitators; child care facilities are provided, selection of activities are appropriate; and food and refreshments are provided at the end of each session. At the beginning of each session participants are reminded about confidentiality amongst the members as this had been previously cited as a major reason for not engaging with the mental health services.","Plans for a Phase 3 trial","http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN19172148","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=3E6E10310FE&grantRef=G0300910","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0300910","DC24D653-B90F-45C6-B9D4-35DADB6AC278","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","28172C1B-1B14-4C0A-A059-EA8F49D151B3"

The 30 novel biomarkers were chosen to represent distinct pathophysiological pathways, for example lipid metabolism, inflammation and myocardial necrosis. These were screened in the population based FINRISK97 cohort (7915 participants, 538 cases of incident CVD at 10 years follow up) and the Belfast PRIME cohort (2551 participants, 260 cases at 10 years of follow up). Of the 30 biomarkers the strongest associations with incident CVD events among FINRISK97 men and women and PRIME men were found between N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (hazard ratio per increment standard deviation in FINRISK97 men cohort 1.23), C-reactive protein (1.23), B-type natriuretic peptide (1.19) and sensitive troponin I (1.18), but no single biomarker consistently improved risk estimation in these three cohorts. Statistical regression and lasso (penalized regression shrinkage) methods selected these three biomarkers; C-reactive protein, B-type natriuretic peptide and sensitive troponin I in combination with conventional risk factors for CVD including blood pressure, cholesterol level, body mass index and history of diabetes to establish a biomarker risk score in FINRISK97 cohort. Testing the biomarker score in the Belfast PRIME validation cohort consistently led to an improved risk estimation of cardiovascular disease.
We are investigating potential sources of funding to move into the next stage of product development i.e. refinement non-clinical and clinical. We are in the process of testing the assay parameters of the multiple biomarker score and assessing modality in additional prospective populations.","We have demonstrated that the biomarker risk score improves risk prediction of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in two European cohorts. The biomarker risk score improves model discriminative accuracy (c-statistic P = 0.0022 in Belfast-PRIME) and also improves the Integrated Discrimination Index (P &lt; 0.0001 in Belfast PRIME). The model improves classification of individuals across clinically defined strata of low (0-5%), intermediate (5-20%) and high (&gt;20%) risk categories (P = 0.0007 in Belfast PRIME) compared to a traditional risk factor model. Indeed, 10 in every 100 patients would benefit from modified management due to this reclassification. The biomarker score has been internally and externally validated in two different European cohorts with high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease highlighting the potential generalizability of the score across several European regions.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=4CA6F1DA530&grantRef=G0601463","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0601463","3DCF2B36-2AF8-4951-B722-424C799E376B","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","EC23DA53-CA73-4104-A3F6-2A9523484E69","696CE1C8-E365-4765-9F3E-C105874C3B06"

Recent studies have shown that lowering blood pressure does not normalise aortic stiffness. However, there is no clinical tool currently available to specifically assess the aortic stiffness, independent of blood pressure, for an individual patient. Solution: We will design and clinically validate a novel tool for clinical use to measure aortic stiffness through an innovative application of magnetic resonance imaging technology. Rationale: To identify high-risk individuals and tailor drug treatment aiming specifically at reducing large artery stiffness and hence mortality/morbity. Development plan: Implementation and validation of realtime MR flow techniques, providing an integrated PC-unit to display changing pulse wave velocity versus physiological parameters in real time and clinical study in hypertensive patients. s

Computerised CRT reduces therapist burden but existing packages have not been designed for schizophrenia. CIRCuiTS is a new, ecologically-valid, graphically and functionally sophisticated computerised CRT programme, driven by clear theoretical principles and relies on well-researched training techniques for schizophrenia. The software is complete, but its feasibility and acceptability, particularly in relation to its method of delivery and dose of treatment have not been assessed. This study will investigate: (a) the acceptability and feasibility of CIRCuiTS for a wide range of cognitive and computer abilities; (b) the extent to which patients need therapist assistance; (c) any therapist interface difficulties that might arise (d) the levels of within-therapy change that impact on outcome cognitive change to provide therapists with a within-therapy goal for task change. Feedback from this study will result in a refined therapeutic manual so that the programme will be ready to be tested in clinical trials.

The Committee heard from a clinical expert that this is a fast-moving area and a lot of research is being done. It also noted that the UK-based PANTS - Personalised Anti-TNF Therapy in Crohn's Disease - study should provide relevant data; but results are not expected until the end of 2016.

It collects data from bedside monitors, calculates in real time 'secondary' parameters defined using highly configurable signal processing formulae and produces continuously updated charts. This way complex information coming off the bedside monitors can be summarized in a concise fashion and presented to medical staff in a simple way that alerts them to the development of various pathological processes.

Novel methods of measurement developed by Marek Czosnyka, Peter Hutchinson, David Menon and John Pickard have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of brain injury, led to commercial applications, and influenced patient care in terms of improved outcome for clinical trials. Multimodality brain monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP), brain oxygen and microdialysis; PET/MRI imaging of critically ill patients; and computerised CSF infusion tests for shunt function in hydrocephalus have each impacted on the clinical practice and the ability to evaluate novel treatments and interventions in brain injury. This work has led directly to the establishment of a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Cooperative for Brain Injury.
Underpinning research
In 1991 a research group was established across Departments in the Cambridge University Clinical School to undertake research in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and abnormalities of CSF. The group was led jointly by Marek Czosnyka (Senior Research Associate, 1991; Professor of Brain Physics, from 2013), Peter Hutchinson (Reader in Neurosurgery, 2008-date; NIHR Professor from 2013), David Menon (University Lecturer, 1993; Professor of Anaesthesia, from 2000) and John Pickard (Professor of Neurosurgery, from 1991). Central to the impact has been the introduction of technologies derived from brain physics for real-time measurement of brain function in the context of acute injury. Technology that combines monitoring and imaging techniques has been licensed and has increased understanding of the pathophysiology of TBI and CSF disorders; defined optimal physiological parameters associated with best outcome in clinical trials; and altered the care of patients in the neurosciences intensive care setting nationally and internationally. The research encompasses four domains:
Brain physics: By applying multimodal brain monitoring1 (introduced 1991) novel indices of cerebrovascular physiology have been defined including autoregulation with the following major findings:
• TBI: (1) cerebrovascular pressure reactivity independently associates with outcome; (2) extremes of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) contribute to worse outcome; and (3) optimal CPP is a valid therapeutic target (2012)2
• CSF: (1) non-invasive ICP can be estimated from cerebral blood flow velocity and arterial pressure (2000); (2) normal pressure hydrocephalus results from a dysfunction of CSF dynamics, white matter softening and dysautoregulation with aging (2008); and (3) idiopathic intracranial hypertension can be treated with venous stenting (2002)3","http://www.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk/icm+home","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=PSyUpfnkvjQ&grantRef=G0600986","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0600986","403421A0-CC02-41AF-BE21-3A423AF2BD3C","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","9D0C5F6D-E2EC-402A-B26D-EF21A234A490"

The PONTI pilot randomized clinical trial has been completed having been started with funding from this MRC Trial Platform Grant. It sought to determine whether inositol treatment, in conjunction with folic acid, may lead to a reduction in the frequency of neural tube defects compared with use of folic acid alone. While the study was small, and not fully powered to detect a statistical effect of inositol, nevertheless we found 3 recurrences of NTD in patients taking folic acid alone, but zero recurrences in a larger group of patients who took inositol plus folic acid. This is encouraging for a further, more statistically powered clinical trial in the coming years. The paper on the pilot study was published in the British Journal of Nutrition, Feb 2016.","Knowledge of the suspected beneficial effects of inositol in pregnancies at high risk of neural tube defect is now widespread, following our animal model studies.

Non-clinical","",,"2015","Under active development/distribution","The stent under development is a novel stent that could be deployed within the side-branch of a coronary bifurcation lesion which would completely appose the side branch with no ingress of stent material within the lumen of the main branch or side branch.
The design of the stent still requires some refinement to achieve its optimum performance. 
Following on from work undertaken previously on an NIHR grant, the current phase of development has led to refinement of the inItial designs leading to new prototype designs that have performed well with computer modelling in terms of succesful simulated deployment within a virtual bifurcation using FEA with good mechanical properties (stress/strain profile, foreshortening and recoil post deployment of the stent). Following the successful FEA work, the stent prototypes were laser-cut from cobalt chromium and crimped onto stent-balloons following a through crimping evaluation process including determination of nominal pressure for deployment and force-dislodgement tests. The stents were then deployed in silicone bifurcation models of different shape and angle of bifurcation, and scanned with Micro-CT. The results of this showed that while the stent prototypes can be deployed as intended, there is an unexpected issue with the size of the stent cell area following deployment. Following review of the data with our industry partners and collaborators we have developed with Promoted Labs 2 further design iterations that aim to address this issue, and are proceeding with further round of FEA and in-vitro testing, prior to in-vivo deployment within porcine arterial bifurcations (coronary, renal and iliofemoral) to assess deployment characteristics and also tissue healing responses and platelet deposition studies. This current work is funded by a research grant awarded by the MRC DPFS funding scheme (MR/L00514X/1). This MRC funding commenced in January 2014, and we have recently been awarded additional funding to continue the work on the novel stent until December 2016.","Development of this novel stent could allow treatment of true coronary bifurcation lesions which would include coverage of the side branch ostial disease, regardless of the angle subtended by the bifurcation, with a standard stent within the main branch, The aim is to improve treatment of this challenging subset of coronary disease.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=FLUVo5wtGFV&grantRef=MR%2FL00514X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/L00514X/1","CA7C894E-5A23-4335-93C8-69AA9B2C5809","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","C842A34F-18F7-454D-A259-FED802368496","4FD05F36-7725-454B-B2E0-67DCF44F875B"

Since November 2013 FARSITE has been utilised for a number of research projects covering new disease areas such as vasculitis, and supporting recruitment to a range of clinical projects.

The Farr funded rollout of FARSITE has continued at pace throughout 2014/15. This partnership with stakeholders across the North's Academic Health Science Networks (AHSN) is a direct result of investment from the Farr Institute Capital award enabling clinical research networks and AHSN teams to utilise the FARSITE platform for service improvement and efficient trial recruitment.","The FARSITE platform for rapid feasibility analysis and recruitment in clinical trials was extended by adding new functionality from research in HeRC on care pathway analysis, which was presented and won a distinguished paper prize at Medinfo 2013 (world's top Health Informatics conference).

The programme comprises 8 2 hours weekly sessions developed by a partnership of peer trainers, a mental health practitioner and an academic. Peer trainers are people with lived experience of mental health problems who are have been recruited and are supported by the local Recovery College which is an established initiative involving a partnership of the health service providers and service user organisations. 

The programme content draws on an adapted version of the Resilience Framework (Hart et al 2007) and a range of other resilience tools and models alongside the personal, practice and research expertise of the facilitators. It aims to increase participants' resilience to respond on an individual and collective basis to the adversities they face using internal and external resources and supports.

The Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is the principle funder of the Peer Trainer and mental health practitioner time and course resources. The University of Brighton has funded the time of the academic staff input.","The 8 week course has now been run a total of 5 times across 2 sites attended by approximately 50 people with mental health problems. Initial evaluation (from rating scales and interviews) suggests participants gained both an increased understanding of resilience and capacity to make resilience 'moves' in response to challenges related to mental health problems.

The Peer Trainers - who are involved in other Recovery College courses - have also reported the level of collaboration in design and delivery to be of a 'gold standard' setting a bench mark for other courses. The collaboration has also developed the research capacity of the Peer Trainers who were very valued active participants in the first research conference/event that they had ever attended - The Imagine Project conference/workshops in Huddersfield 2015.","https://www.sussexrecoverycollege.org.uk/courses/west-sussex-campuses/12-west-sussex/103-building-resilience-for-wellness-and-recovery","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=56436b62570d51.65768401&grantRef=ES%2FK002686%2F2","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=ES/K002686/2","13CEA411-3824-4F7A-A82A-649754C1224B","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","99A178DB-8888-4BB2-8AA3-D027E7283900"

Novel CRP inhibitor compounds are currently in pre-clinical development. After extensive evaluation the original compound, BPC8, for the development of which the DCS award was given in 2010, was found not be optimal for further development. In 2012 the MRC awarded Sir Mark additional funds for a back up chemistry programme to rationally design and synthesise new candidate molecules drawing on the results so far with BPC8. This programme continues and two promising candidate molecules are currently being synthesised by a CRO. In a progress report to the MRC Sir Mark described the novel molecules which have been designed, synthesised and tested so far. Unsurprisingly for such a novel programme none evaluated so far have been optimal for development, however the results of these evaluations have provided important knowledge for the design of subsequent compounds. Two promising compounds are currently being synthesised by a CRO and are due for delivery early November. Unfortunately the MRC have deemed the programme to now be too different from the original plan and have decided to terminate the award. A termination plan has been submitted and we await approval. In the meantime evaluation of the newest compounds will continue with a view to seeking further funds if one or more of these should prove worthy of full scale pre-clinical evaluation.","The work was published in Nature in 2006 and was the subject of the cover illustration and additional material in the journal.

Conditioning the immune response of solid organ transplant recipients towards allograft acceptance using cell-based therapies is now becoming technically
feasible and clinically promising. The central focus of the ONE Study cooperative work programme is to: produce and manufacture distinct populations of haematopoietic immunoregulatory cells comparatively study the immunosuppressive characteristics of these regulatory cell types

Patients with liver cirrhosis are particularly at risk of getting bacterial infections, and these can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This affects brain function and can cause symptoms that range from changes in personality to altered memory, concentration, or even loss of consciousness, affecting quality of life in a major way and often leading to hospital admission, and sometimes even the need for liver transplantation.

Gay men are randomised to have access to daily oral Truvada at enrolment or after one year of follow-up, and all participants have access to the standard prevention package throughout.

Truvada as PrEP has been licensed as PrEP in the USA and this is a pilot study.

Funding provided through: MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Public Health England, and Gilead Sciences. 

544 study participants currently in active follow up.

The PROUD trial reported at the Conference for Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), February 2015 http://www.croiwebcasts.org/console/player/25539?mediaType=audio&amp;","PROUD was a game changer for PrEP for two reasons. Firstly Truvada was more effective at preventing HIV in this open-label pilot phase than in previously reported placebo-controlled trials, and secondly the trial schedule mirrored routine practice with quarterly visits, whereas previous trials had followed a monthly schedule. The study was conducted in men who have sex with men (MSM) attending sexual health clinics in England. When PROUD announced the decision to offer PrEP to those whose access was deferred, IPERGAY asked their Data Monitoring Committee to advise them what to do in their placebo-controlled trial which was also being conducted in MSM, in France. It transpired that Truvada was equally effective when MSM were advised to take drug before and after sex. This caused tremendous excitement when the results were presented back to back at an international conference, and the excitement sparked enthusiasm across Europe.

In November 2015 the French regulatory authority approved the use of Truvada as PrEP on a named patient basis, and the French Minister of Health announced at the end of the same month that the costs of the drug would be fully reimbursed by the social security system. NHS England is about to issue a Commissioning Policy for public consultation.","http://www.proud.mrc.ac.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=NdjYsZQiRyt&grantRef=MC_U122861322","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_U122861322","CC567E92-EB53-416C-87A8-9A9199E01B40","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","666A7C6D-E59C-4C37-8997-490B93914C41","7E3C0045-B615-48B0-B761-74896FEED7ED"

For some diseases the immunogens are not known and for others they are difficult and expensive to produce, transport and administer, for example influenza vaccine must be produced in millions of chicken eggs. A very attractive potential solution is to inject the DNA gene encoding the immunogen rather than the immunogen itself. In this process, known as DNA vaccination, the DNA enters cells, predominantly at the site of injection, and causes them to produce the immunogen locally within the body. DNA vaccination works well and stimulates excellent protective immunity against a variety of different infections, and even some cancers, in mice, horses, dogs, rabbits and pigs. But in humans and other primates, and in cows and sheep, the immune response to DNA vaccination is very feeble. Despite enormous academic and pharmaceutical industry efforts, the reasons for this failure have not been understood or overcome. We previously discovered, in work funded by the MRC, that a protein in human plasma, known as serum amyloid P component (SAP), is the only normal plasma protein which binds avidly to DNA. We have now found that, in each of the animal species in which DNA vaccination is effective, this protein is either absent or, if it is present, it binds only weakly to DNA. In contrast, non-human primates, cows and sheep share with humans the presence of SAP proteins which strongly bind to DNA. We believe that binding of DNA by SAP may be responsible for blocking induction of immune responses by DNA and that removal of SAP may overcome this inhibition. SAP contributes to important human diseases, amyloidosis and Alzheimer's disease, and, in MRC funded work towards treatment for these conditions, we have previously developed a drug, CPHPC, which safely removes almost all SAP from the blood in humans. Another laboratory has recently reported that the presence of human SAP inhibits DNA vaccination in mice and that this effect is reversed by our drug, CPHPC. These observations confirm our hypothesis. We are now undertaking the first human clinical study of DNA vaccination after SAP depletion, funded by an MRC DCS award. We will measure the immune responses to HIV-1 in normal adult men, comparing a group in whom SAP has been completely depleted at the time of DNA vaccination and a control group vaccinated without SAP depletion. We predict that SAP depletion at the time of vaccination will enhance the immune response. The DNA vaccine to be tested is a promising new vaccine against HIV-AIDS, developed and manufactured with previous MRC awards. A positive result, consistent with improved protective immunity against HIV-1, will be very encouraging. Furthermore, proof of the concept that SAP depletion can enhance immune responses to DNA vaccination in humans will open up this approach for the many other diseases for which effective vaccination does not yet exist and in which it could have therapeutic as well as prophylactic benefits. Success in the clinical trial undertaken here with an HIV-1 vaccine will establish a critical proof of concept, opening the way to general application of our new approach. The clinical trial has begun. The first two subjects have been successfully screened and randomised and have been admitted to the CRF. CPHPC infusion has taken place and they have now received the first DNA vaccination. The programme is funded by MRC DCS award MR/J008605/1.","The intervention is still in early stage clinical assessment.","http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/Search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=14680","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=UdSPYHzumst&grantRef=MR%2FJ008605%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/J008605/1","F21DBD4F-CFDC-4B61-A7FA-FF262FB7DCD1","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","72A324FF-B975-443D-BDD8-19E9649401E7"

With Wellcome Trust, DSTL, EPSRC and TSB funding, we have identified a chymotrypsin from the secretions of L.sericata which completely digests eschar from human venous leg ulcers ex vivo and promotes alterations in fibroblast behaviour conducive to healing. This makes this particular chymotrypsin a prime candidate for development as a next generation wound debridement agent. Consequently, the enzyme has been cloned and expressed at a prototype level, and shown to mimic the effects of the whole organism in ex vivo debridement assays. Furthermore, we have incorporated the recombinant enzyme in a prototype formulation which clearly outperforms the leading competitor product Santyl. Confidence is high that the enzyme can now be developed through scale-up, formulation and toxicology to be ready for clinical evaluation within 2 years. The aim of the proposed project is to develop the product to a stage suitable for application ot wounds in patients.

Its goal is not to ensure complete clinical competence in the use of a guiding style for talking about behaviour change. Rather it is to start this process. As such it is an introduction to a set of skills that learners can practice and get better at using as they refine their efforts in everyday practice. The programme owes quite a lot of its content to motivational interviewing, but also leans on wisdom from other sources, like behaviour therapy. Above all, the goal was to adapt some of these more complex psychological methods into a form that is applicable in the everyday practice of doctors and nurses in primary care.","The study is still ongoing and aims to assess the effectiveness of our Behaviour Change intervention in changing health related behaviours, i.e. smoking, alcohol drinking, unhealthy eating, and lack of physical activity. Therefore, the anticipated impact would be on the quality of this type of communication, as well as improvements in patients' health. The training programme is designed to be part of the CPD for practitioners within primary care and therefore, once tested and if successful, it is likely to influence the existing postgraduate teaching curriculum.

Non-clinical","",,"2013","Actively seeking support","&quot;With a greater understanding of the processes involved in inflammatory disease, &quot;&quot;biologics&quot;&quot; such as anti-cytokine antibody can be a useful therapy. There are problems however, including their high cost: the need for intravenous infusions: and the high specificity of the antibody which limits their usefulness to diseases in which the targeted cytokine is the &quot;&quot;driver&quot;&quot; or rate limiting step. Our approach however aims (i) to inhibit a rate limiting step common to inflammatory cell extravasation (regardless of the cytokines &quot;&quot;drivers&quot;&quot;) by (ii) producing a small molecule inhibitor which can be taken orally. Our approach aims to inhibit the enzyme underlying the white cell morphology change (&quot;spreading&quot; onto the endothelium), namely the intracellular enzyme calpain-1, From knowledge of the structure of the novel Ca2+ binding site on calpain-1, blocking molecules are being designed. We are therefore synthesising compounds which target activation of this enzyme. We already have a novel calpain-1 inhibitor at least 10 times more potent that others reported to date.

A number of pharmaceutical companies have programmes to develop biological agents (e.g. antibodies) that inhibit NgR1 function (Biogen, Novartis and GSK). We have used virtual screening to identify the first small drug-like NgR1 inhibitors; however, for reasons discussed in section 4.2 below we would like to identify additional hits to advance this programme. To this end we have used similar in silico techniques to identify ~100 compounds that are closely related to the existing hits, as well as ~100 novel candidates all from the ChemBridge library of 800,000 compounds. The aim of this project is to obtain evidence that our &quot;in-house&quot; approach can identify novel selective NgR1 antagonists, and to use this as the starting point for seeking funding for a major drug discovery programme.

These 2 novel dendrimers have demonstrated their ability to carry DNA by formation of complexes, which occurred almost instantaneously and was stable over at least 24h. In vitro transfection experiment revealed that the conjugation of Lf to DAB led to a significantly improved transfection compared to DAB-Tf on A431 carcinoma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors. A qualitative analysis of the targeting efficacy of these delivery systems by confocal microscopy revealed that the co-localization of fluorescently-labelled DNA in the nucleus was more pronounced after treatment with DAB-Lf dendriplex compared to unconjugated dendriplex.
The conjugation of lactoferrin and lactoferricin to the dendrimer significantly increased the gene expression in the tumor while decreasing the non-specific gene expression in the liver. Consequently, the intravenous administration of the targeted dendriplexes encoding TNFa led to the complete suppression of 60% of A431 tumors and up to 50% of B16-F10 tumors over one month. The treatment was well tolerated by the animals.
These results suggest that these novel lactoferrin- and lactoferricin-bearing dendrimers are promising gene delivery systems for cancer therapy.","This research will address the unmet need of tumour-targeted delivery of plasmid DNA by intravenous administration, which is currently the subject of much research worldwide. Numerous highly promising therapeutic genes cannot be used clinically because of their failure to specifically reach remote tumours by intravenous administration. This represents a frustrating impasse, resulting in many potentially life-saving therapeutics being unavailable until this delivery issue is solved. The impact of our proposed project is therefore likely to be significant.
This research is at the interface of cancer therapy and gene delivery. As a result, it will be of interest to the thousands of academics investigating these topics worldwide. This will include the scientists involved in cancer biology, gene delivery, biomaterials, pharmaceutics, as well as clinical oncologists.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=rTjC2QgXHPv&grantRef=MR%2FJ007129%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/J007129/1","FCD0CD2D-0039-44D5-8A13-21A5C952578D","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","5BB4F8BF-B4E0-4EAF-9AF5-885E19D64850","8FB1848C-70B7-4980-84B3-F82F45C7BF4D"

This Phase I trial is funded by a DCS Award form the MRC with support from the Wellcome Trust Funded UK HVC

Four different products have been trialled and data is currently being analysed.

DNA
A two parts product including one plasmid encodes ZM96 Clade C gag-pol-nef derived from the 96ZM651-8 clone construct developed by B.H. Hahn, G.M. Shaw and F. Gao at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The other encodes CN54 Clade C env derived from the HIV-1 97CN54 coding sequences (Geneart). Both sequence optimised inserts were introduced into the VRC8400 CMV/R vector (NIAID/NIH) for GMP manufacture. Vaccines have been manufactured by Althea Technology, Inc (USA).

MVA-C
The MVA-C has been developed by M. Esteban at the Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia of CSIC and expresses the HIV-1 protein gp120 and the fusion protein gag-pol-nef from HIV-1 97CN54. Volunteers will receive 1.10e8 TCID50 in a volume of 0.5mls. Vaccine has been manufactured by Bavarian Nordic (Denmark).

CN54rgp140
The CN54rgp140 is a recombinant GP140 derived from the HIV-1 CN54 coding sequence and has been manufactured by Polymun, Austria. CN54rGP140, is a trimeric recombinant C-clade ENV protein, derived from the 97CN54 Chinese viral isolate. 

GLA-AF
In the current trial we will use a completely synthetic aqueous monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL&reg;) like molecule GLA-AF,. MPL is a component of human vaccines including Cervarix which is used to prevent certain types of human papilloma virus infection associated with cervical cancer and is licensed for use in the European Union.

The manufacture of these products has been paid for by a Wellcome Trust Award. This study is conducted in collaboration with the University of Surrey (Dr David Lewis).

As of November 2014 all participants have been enrolled and have completed their immunisation schedule.","The global health burden associated with HIV continues to grow with 35 million people estimated to be living with HIV in 2014. Despite a huge expansion of access to ART with an estimated 12.9 million people on ART by the end of 2013, leaving others in urgent need of therapy whilst 2.1 million new infections were identified in the same year. With the exception of male circumcision and the challenging Pre-Exposure prophylasis there has been disappointing outcomes from most other prevention strategies on HIV incidence.

A successful and safe HIV vaccine would have considerable benefits across the general populations and high risk groups. It could have the potential to prevent over 70 million infections over the course of 15 years. Should the trial identify a promising vaccine constructs or strategies, the research would support the design of the next clinical studies and provide an opportunity to inform and support decisions and policy making in several areas of HIV prevention.

The Manufacturing process was documented and formed the basis for an online tool for researchers willing to take vaccine candidates from the bench to the clinic.

http://www.vaccineenterprise.org/Benchtoclinic

From Bench to Clinic is a webtool to help researchers most efficiently move their candidate vaccines into first-in-human trials. With a focus on the practical steps that need to be accomplished before a clinical trial can be initiated, this tool is intended to acquaint researchers, funders and advocates, with the processes, costs and timelines involved in the first phase of product development.","http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/Search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=14173","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=e5hZRXw7pW6&grantRef=G1001784","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G1001784","E7BBAD70-CB42-44FB-9D2B-3F39B0CDF441","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","2D017551-27A1-4A44-9411-71B10309F61F"

Dr Roman Hovorka will build on his successful research into an artificial pancreas for people with Type 1 diabetes to study its safety and effectiveness for the treatment of hospital inpatients with Type 2 diabetes

Research aims

Dr Roman Hovorka and his team will build on their successful studies of a prototype artificial pancreas for people with Type 1 diabetes to investigate its use for the management of Type 2 diabetes in hospital inpatients. The researchers will study the safety and effectiveness of the system in 20 inpatients with insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes over a 72-hour period. They will compare the results obtained to those achieved by 20 inpatients using conventional insulin injection therapy.
As in previous trials, the artificial pancreas system will involve using a portable computer to link a continuous glucose sensor with an insulin pump - enabling them to talk intelligently to each other. The system will continuously measure glucose levels in the body and rapidly adjust the insulin dose provided to maintain these levels within a target range.","N/A",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=54624ee3f1b052.32845260&grantRef=MC_PC_12012","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_PC_12012","97E8CEC6-D738-4A91-9118-61BC8FB91B4A","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","FC381D2E-B59F-4997-BF2B-D435B2966717"

MucoVac 1 (EudraCT number 2007-000781-20) was the first human clinical trial to have used the trimeric CN54gp140 although the protein was not administered systemically but topically. To date Mucovac 2 (EudraCT number 2010-019103-27) is the only completed trial to have generated safety data on the systemic administration of the CN54gp140 in GLA-AF in healthy participants. 100 and 20?g of protein was administered I.M after bedside mixing with GLA-AF (an aqueous formulation of synthetic MPLA). Analysis of the (presumed) peak antibody responses measured after the last immunisation demonstrated induction of robust antibody responses, with moderate neutralization activity against easy to neutralize tier 1 viral isolates.

Phase I clinical trials of the RSV vaccine have been undertaken","Phase I clinical trials, funded by Okarios and GSK, of the novel RSV vaccine have been undertaken and the vaccine was shown to be safe and immunogenic in adults. RSV is a major cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants, affecting ~64 million children annually, worldwide. In the UK, 2 to 3% of infants &lt;1 year of age are hospitalised each year due to RSV. Children who experience RSV disease early in life run a high risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma. Although nearly all children are infected with RSV by 2 years of age, immunity following natural infection is incomplete and re-infections are common. The economic impact of RSV in adults and burden of disease in the elderly are comparable to or greater than that of seasonal influenza. There is no effective RSV vaccine or anti-viral therapy, apart from antibody prophylaxis for high risk individuals. An effective RSV vaccine is needed that can be deployed in infants to induce protection against lower respiratory tract disease, and which can be used to boost immunity in adults and the elderly.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=mwLm1uc4ruM&grantRef=MR%2FJ014648%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/J014648/1","3EBFD45D-674A-4AC4-9560-957ED1A85473","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","59EE6C94-CB2C-4AB3-9A0B-EAAF5A6550CD","5DC8742C-F283-44E9-9393-25DE98BDE551"

Our double-blind RCT sought initial proof-of-effect (n=52) for the procedure, comparing the safety and efficacy of different treatment doses at 4 weeks post-intervention. We are now preparing a new funding application to the MRC to support a second round of protocol optimisation prior to a much larger effectiveness study.","Ninety five percent confidence intervals (n=52) indicated that all three treatment arms showed a statistically significant improvement between the pre-stimulation baseline and the final day of stimulation on the primary outcome measure, the conventional tests of the Behavioural Inattention Test. This change (mean change=28%, SD=18) was still evident 1month later. Secondary analyses indicated an allied increase of 20% in median Barthel Index score, a measure of functional capacity, in the absence of any adverse events or instances of participant non-compliance. Together these data suggest that galvanic vestibular stimulation, a simple, cheap technique suitable for home-based administration, may produce lasting reductions in neglect that are clinically important.

It followed a feasibility study to assess the acceptability of the randomisation to clinicians and patients. 

The trial completed recruitment in August 20010 with 552 women recruited. It is currently in follow-up. Results were presented in the main gynaecological cancer oral session at the American Society of Oncology Annual Meeting 2013. 

The principle source of funding is a CRUK CTAAC trial grant.

The only pharmacologically useful molecules known to inhibit CypA are cyclopsporines (CsA). Non-immunosuppressive CsA analogues are showing promising in phase 2 clinical trials for HCV infection. Based on virtual screening and structural studies we have identified six different chemical scaffolds that inhibit cylophilin isomerise activity in the low micromolar range. Modelling studies show that with appropriate chemical derivitisation the scaffolds could be turned into lead compounds for drug development. We will design, synthesise and screen large bead-based libraries of compounds (thousands to hundreds of thousands, depending on SAR and building block availability). This approach will enable us to identify submicromolar binders and generate SAR binding data from primary screening. Viral screens will be carried out with our potential commercial partners (Debiopharm, Switzerland). Leads generated would represent first in class lmw non-peptide CypA inhibitors.

We have two main aims: Firstly to achieve rapid expansion of SAR space around our lead series, while establishing optimal potency, selectivity and
in vivo analgesic efficacy. This will bring us to a position, well placed to submit a strong composition of
matter patent on novel TRPM8 agonists for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Secondly, and key to our
medicinal chemistry efforts, will be the development of at least one back-up series of compounds that will
significantly strengthen our overall IP position and de-risk the project. This is central to the long term
funding of the project either through WT Seeding Drug Discovery awards (applied for Nov 09), or
partnership with various pharma companies.
Future Outcome: Partnership with pharma through NeurocentRx and building of value in the company. It
should be noted that this programme is anticipated to complement a broader PAIN PROGRAMME,
encompassing a clinical study validating the target and approach, with this project forming a fast follower
product as typically seen in pharma pipelines. Together they provide for an attractive licensable package.

In spite of all efforts, the former did not end up receiving commercial interest, partially because the IP situation was not clear (earlier patents, while less specific, were judged to weaken the basis for a device). The TOM device has been developed now into a stand-alone unit, and used to characterise PY impact characteristics, as well as how these differ among UK and US resuscitation providers [R5]. This information, and the device, will now be employed in training of the first responder community involved in study [O1], to conduct a part-II investigation into PT outcomes after appropriate training of staff. This is work in progress. This device is suitable for characterisation of Pre-cordial Thump-like (PT) fist impact mechanics using light barriers for speed and polymer sensors for force recordings. 2003 External Cardiac Mechanical Stimulator GB 0301848.8 [PCT/GB04/000342]; Inventors: Peter Kohl (University of Oxford) &amp; Christian Boulin (EMBL Heidelberg).","Pre-cordial Thump (PT) can be combined with standard resuscitatory interventions without significant time-delay or apparent side effects. PT efficacy in Cardiac Arrest VF/VT (Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia) and Cardiac arrestPEA (Pulseless electrical activity) is lacking. However, PT may offer potential for the increasing proportion of asystolic Out-Of-Hospital-Cardiac Arrest, in particular when witnessed. While this proved very useful in relating some of the discrepancies observed in a parallel questionnaire-based study of US and UK experience with PT, the initial thump-o-meter suffered from a limited frequency response of the force transducers. This did not allow us to obtain true dynamic measures of actual impact mechanics. An advanced device has therefore been designed which utilises a spring-loaded platform for impact mechanics characterisation. Preliminary recordings, obtained from professionals at Oxford's John Radcliffe hospital, showed that this device provides extremely accurate dynamic recordings of both speed and displacement (measure of force).

It works by using mid-IR absorption to measure the ratios of chemical in a tissue slice taken from a suspected cancer site. At the moment clinicians diagnose and monitor the disease by subjectively grading these slices visually, after they have been stained with &quot;H+E&quot; vegetable dyes.

Our technique augments this &quot;H+E&quot; protocol, but its a quantitative measure of the chemical changes (specifically the ratio of the concentration of phosphate groups from the DNA to the amount of Amide groups from cell proteins) known to accompany the disease, and we believe this will make it more selective and sensitive a measure than current histopathology. 

The cancer biopsies are chemically fixed, and hospitals archive them for many years so clinical trials are easy for us to perform. We work with pathology professionals who curate large cohorts of specimens, and we can go back , years after they were harvested, when the clinical outcomes and treatments are known and documented. This way we can trial and validate out technology ate a fraction of the effort and cost that it would take if we need to work with live patients. We've made and patented a prototype machine, capable of being operated, with a single mouse click, by a path. lab. technician and its currently undergoing clinical trials with IC cancer specialists at Charing Cross Hospital. 

Imperial's tech transfer company , Imperial Innovations, have financed the patents, funded a &pound;25 k business analysis/market survey, and provided bridging funding to finance the trials.

Recently we secured NHS funding for a much larger trials, in collabotration with medics at Nottingham ( Prof Ian EEllis) and Cambridge ( Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald) on breast and oesophageal cancer respectively.","C Phillips and H Amrania &quot;Infrared Laser Device for Digitally Stained Tissue Images. &quot; G B Patent, filed Oct 15th 2007, Application number 0720097.5

This was ready for clinical trials in 2000 but the prolonged battle for funding support from the MRC and pharma was unsuccessful until 2009 when some of the IP was licensed to GSK for treatment of systemic amyloidosis. Five years later the clinical trial of that treatment has been shown to be successful, winning major milestone awards, Orphan Drug status, etc. The MRC completely failed to either understand the need for studies in Alzheimer's disease and dementia, or to provide funding for these. However the NIHR first provided core support for the Pepys team in 2012, followed by &pound;1 million for trial preparations in 2013, and finally a Strategic Award in 2014 of &pound;2.571 million to fund the clinical trial. Pepys has now also been invited by the Alzheimer's Society-Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation to apply for two new grants of $1.5 million each for trials of his drug in cerebral amyloid angiopathy and traumatic brain injury respectively.","In addition to the generous funding from the NIHR, contrasting sharply with the failure of the MRC to support one of the major outputs from its previous continuous funding of Pepys's research since 1969, the work on CPHPC for Alzheimer's and related diseases is also strongly supported by GSK. They are critically important partners in development at all levels in a synergistic relationship which is a paradigm of collaboration between academia and the pharma industry.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=5460b4b73cbf29.74502695&grantRef=G7900510","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G7900510","FA4479B9-FFED-4BD0-9294-CA32EEAC4047","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","72A324FF-B975-443D-BDD8-19E9649401E7"

This aims to determine the effect of a dose of Heme arginate (either 1mg/kg or 3mg/kg) on the level of the anti-inflammatory enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It will also aim to verify the drug's safety in this elderly and comorbid patient population as although Heme arginate has been used for over 20 years in the treatment of patients with porphyria, it has not previously been used extensively in this cohort. 
If this trial confirms that Heme arginate does effectively upregulate hemeoxygenase-1 without significant adverse effects, then we would take these data forward to perform a randomised controlled trial of Heme arginate versus placebo.

• Objectives: a) to identify the level of risk that patients may be willing to take, and investigate whether this is related to their symptom burden and quality-of-life, and b) to elicit attitudes to risk and uncertainty and the range of influences affecting patients' choice and decision making.
• Mixed method study. a) Quantitative: Modified Standard Gamble to measure patient's willingness to take biomarker-led care depending on different levels of risk (sensitivity and specificity). Quality-of-life and symptom burden questionnaires will also be completed. b) Qualitative study comprises in-depth semi-structured interviews to investigate influences on choices and decision-making. 
• Hypothesis: high symptom burden and low quality of life is positively associated with a willingness to take risks associated with less accurate biomarker tests. Qualitative interviews will inform whether risk perception is related to particular factors other than symptom burden.
We anticipate this study will develop the methodology to incorporate patient's preference into the translation of biomarker tests into clinical practice.","NOT YET CURRENTLY DATA COLLECTING",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=gbhLp4thWU3&grantRef=MR%2FJ006742%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/J006742/1","5C9020B5-5161-48B8-BD61-E87E2A3C904C","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","318B5D98-4CB4-4B10-A876-08FC93071A56","893D66CD-2721-4DA1-BC08-7050127B4B3A"

Clinical","",,"2011","Under active development/distribution","&quot;Approximately 70,000 newborns/yr in the UK (10% of births) require some form of resuscitation at birth. Many of these are premature or sick increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality. Newborns resuscitated but not admitted to the neonatal unit have an increased risk of poor cognitive function in later life. Heart rate (HR) is the best indicator of effective resuscitation and is currently assessed manually using a stethoscope. However, this is subject to human error, introduces delays, and may fail to detect a sudden deterioration. Hence, there is an urgent need for a HR monitor designed specifically for newborn delivery room resuscitation as current devices are unsuitable. This device aims to improve resuscitation practice, potentially improving outcomes and reducing time spent in intensive care. We have developed and patented a HR sensor specifically for this purpose. Preliminary work has demonstrated its use on babies in intensive care. DPFS funding is sought to further develop the technology for resuscitation in the delivery room and measure key performance parameters: namely accuracy, reliability and acquisition time. By placing this device in the hands of midwives and clinicians we aim to improve resuscitation in those infants at greatest risk of short and long term sequelae.

Non-clinical","",,"2011","Closed","&quot;This is academic/industry collaboration between KCL, Brandeis University and Smiths Detection. Clostridium difficile (CD) is a major cause of hospital/healthcare outbreaks of diarrhoea, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. CD causes disease by production of toxins A and B (encoded by genes tcdA, tcdB). Recent outbreaks have been due to virulent strains, most commonly ribotype 027, which produces an additional binary toxin (encoded by cdtA, cdtB) and hyperproduces toxin because of variation in the repressor gene tcdC. Rapid diagnosis is essential for patient management and infection control. Diagnosis is usually by Enzyme Immuno-Assay (EIA) of toxins A and B, but performance of present kits is unsatisfactory. Detection of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is more specific but does not distinguish toxigenic from non-toxigenic strains. One commercial PCR system for detection of genes for B and binary toxins and one genetic variation in tcdC has been announced performance data are limited. There is a need for a rapid test to simultaneously detect genes for toxins A/B and binary, toxin hyperproduction and CD type. We propose to develop such a test using the Smiths Bioseeq automated LATE-PCR system, which allows complex multiplexing and can be run safely by non-specialised staff in non-laboratory settings.

The reliable assessment of these biomarkers in biological samples, particularly those from the clinic, has proved challenging; immunohistochemistry in this context has been poorly controlled, minimally quantified and lacking in the specificity required. Prior work has established that an optical, coincidence detection approach can drive specificity to yield spatially resolved, robust and meaningful patient data. We have now translated the principle of coincidence detection into a novel coincidence biodetector that has been tested successfully as a coincidence readout. Through the generation of a small repertoire of recombinant detectors fused to this novel coincidence readout, we now propose to establish the proof of concept for this biomarker approach

Transcutaneous oestrogen avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism and therefore is not expected to be associated with the cardiovascular (CVS) toxicity previously seen with oral oestrogen. It may also avoid some of the serious side-effects associated with LHRHa.

The primary outcome measures will be overall survival and progression-free survival. The secondary outcome measures include prostate cancer specific survival, hormone levels, CVS and other toxicity, and quality of life. 

Data from the trial so far have shown promising evidence of the safety and efficacy of OP. Results from the first stage of the trial which aimed to assess the safety and activity of the patches have been published (n= 254), showing the patches produced castrate levels of testosterone similar to LHRHa, with no evidence of excess CVS toxicity. During the second stage, a pre-planned interim analysis (n=638) reviewed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee in June 2013 led to the trial being extended for a phase III evaluation of the patch efficacy.","Results from a bone health sub-study embedded within PATCH have shown transdermal oestrogen protects against the bone mineral density loss seen with LHRHa. In addition, patients on patches appear to develop more favourable metabolic profiles and have a number of improved short-term quality of life outcomes compared to those on LHRHa therapy. However, the clinical efficacy of the patches needs confirming within a phase III trial setting before they can be considered as part of standard care in prostate cancer.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=56d5b84ce9e815.48011669&grantRef=MC_UU_12023%2F28","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_UU_12023/28","1BCAF1CB-1489-449B-9E2A-2AD84EE6D661","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","3591B22B-5D64-4E64-88AB-6FF834EBF6BF"

Current choice of affinity tags is rather limited with biotin-streptavidin system being the market leader due to the irreversible interaction of the small drug-like biotin with the tetrameric protein, streptavidin. Here we report a novel affinity system which utilizes two monomeric polypeptides which can interact in an irreversible manner. This system utilizes the unique stability of the recently discovered tetrahelical coiled-coil complex which is known as the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein complex. We achieved the binary system by tandem linking of the SNARE coiled coils. As a proof of principle we demonstrate that a recombinant enzyme expressed in bacteria, glutathione S-transferase, can be quickly and permanently immobilized on a gel matrix in a single step starting with the bacterial detergent extract. Our non-covalent, site-directed and yet irreversible immobilization of the enzyme preserves the activity of the immobilized enzyme and may be used as a convenient alternative to the streptavidin-biotin system or chemical linking.","manuscript submitted for publication",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=EF242FC37BA&grantRef=MC_U105178791","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_U105178791","877D45C8-1DB7-4537-A216-2FF64D10E949","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","AB7C0822-BBCB-4C61-85EC-5D13C7A31759","A4B75635-B5CA-4813-867C-E1A3FF17C446"

It is a broad-based community mobilization platform, which involves grouping 20-30 households who reside in the same sub-locality into development teams, and then, each team is organized into one-to-five networks of six households living in the same neighborhood. The members of the networks are women. This intervention approach was conceived as a result of the MRC funded project. During the initiation stage of our project, our research team was involved in stakeholder engagement activities to create awareness of the objectives and methodology of the research project. During these multiple discussions with various key stakeholders in Borena zone, in addition to the inappropriateness of the existing Health Extension Program for pastoral context, another key challenge voiced by many was lack of community mobilization and participation affecting the pastoral health system. To address this challenge and strengthen community mobilization and ownership, we designed networks of women development army based on a similar approach designed for agrarian communities in Ethiopia. This community engagement approach is being subjected to formative evaluation through funding secured from the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie). The 3ie funding (PI: Hailay Desta Teklehaimanot) started in December 2015. At this stage, women are being organized into development teams and one-to-five networks, which will be followed by a series of evaluations and revisions to come up with the best community engagement approach for pastoral context. The approach will also be evaluated for its impact in improving immunization coverage.","Before the intervention is subjected to formative evaluation, the Zonal Health Department and Zonal Women Affairs are interested and making preparations to implement it in all villages of the zone.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=56e0794b70f752.93079178&grantRef=MR%2FM006050%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/M006050/1","9FC36C6D-ED27-47CF-8106-50BE7576A6C3","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","04DB43B9-3E27-4EFF-90BC-C04F9EACE235","D2CE390A-CCB3-44FB-971B-63AD13126D02"

This is particularly the case for the orally available EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib/Tarceva and gefitinib/Iressa in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers. This proposal will build on our observation that only a fraction of EGFR-positive tumours exhibit elevated EGFR signalling activity, and our prediction that only these patients will respond to inhibitor therapy. In this proposal we plan to adapt and optimise the tissue collection and protein detection methodology (focussing on a new, quantitative and exquisitely sensitive technology) such that we can measure EGFR signalling activity in samples obtained during routine clinical diagnosis. The methodology will then be used in a feasibility study of EGFR signalling in patients enrolled in an erlotinib trial. This will provide the data necessary to secure substantial follow-on funding to undertake a fully powered multicentre prospective clinical trial aimed at testing our central hypothesis, and so deliver a validated companion diagnostic for routine clinical practice. This has the potential to improve patient care and clinical outcomes, and also to allow significant cost savings to the NHS and other health care providers.

I have extensive experience of working in research groups that cross clinical and pre-clinical studies into psychiatric disorders. My PhD and subsequent research were undertaken in the Psychopharmacology Unit, Bristol with Prof Nutt and my fellowship enabled me to work the Cambridge Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute in Experimental Psychology in Cambridge. Using this background I have been able to develop a model that has the potential to detect a core symptom of anxiety disorders, negative affective state. Having used reverse translation to develop this approach, we now propose to take this model back into humans thus enabling us to take this strategy from bedside to bench and back again. This project will combine our model development with a second, translational method, the use of CO2- inhalation to induce anxiety.

There are currently no clinical treatments which directly target amyloid deposits for elimination. The Pepys team first identified and validated human serum amyloid P component (SAP) as a therapeutic target in amyloidosis in the mid 1990s. In vitro, SAP both enhances amyloid fibril formation and protects amyloid fibrils from proteolytic degradation by macrophages. In collaboration with Roche they developed the novel palindromic bis-D-proline compound (R)-1-[6-[(R)-2-Carboxy-Pyrrolidin-1-yl]-6-oxo-Hexanoyl]Pyrrolidine-2-Carboxylic acid (CPHPC), which was intended to prevent SAP from binding to amyloid fibrils in vivo and dissociate bound SAP from amyloid deposits (Nature 2002). CPHPC is avidly bound by human SAP in a complex composed of two native pentameric SAP molecules cross linked by 5 bivalent CPHPC molecules. The complex is perceived as abnormal by the liver and instantly cleared, leading to profound depletion of SAP from the circulation which persists for as long as the drug is administered (PNAS 2009). Targeted depletion of a pathogenic protein by a small molecule drug constitutes a potent, novel pharmacological mechanism. The depletion of plasma SAP also clears most of the SAP from amyloid deposits but the affinity of SAP for CPHPC is insufficient to produce complete dissociation of all SAP from amyloid deposits in the face of the continuous production of 50-100 mg of new SAP per day and the avid binding of SAP to amyloid fibrils. CPHPC is well tolerated by patients and has been administered to more than 60 subjects for a total of more than 50 patient years without any adverse effects. But up to about 10% of the amyloid associated SAP remains in major visceral amyloid deposits even after months of continuous CPHPC treatment. Nevertheless we have not observed any new amyloid accumulation in patients on CPHPC, even those in whom there was progressive deposition before and after CPHPC exposure. Furthermore there were encouraging signs of prolonged renal and possibly patient survival in subjects receiving CPHPC. However we have not detected any amyloid regression. Thus while CPHPC may be a useful adjunct to other therapy for amyloidosis it does not itself promote elimination of the deposits. Pentraxin acquired full ownership of CPHPC from Roche in December 2008.
The capacity of CPHPC to clear essentially all SAP from the circulation, while leaving significant amounts of SAP specifically bound in the amyloid deposits, suggested the possibility of using the residual SAP as an amyloid-specific target for antibodies which can invoke physiological clearance of amyloid from the tissues. Depletion of circulating SAP crucially allows such antibodies to be administered safely and effectively. This approach is unrelated to the function of SAP itself and simply uses SAP as a passive amyloid-specific target. It has been remarkably successful in experimental models (Nature 2010) and should be applicable to all forms of amyloidosis although its safety and efficacy, especially for amyloid in different organs and tissues, will have to be, and is being, carefully evaluated. GlaxoSmithKline licensed the invention of this first in class combination of a small molecule drug and a monoclonal antibody from Pentraxin in February 2009. They have already fully humanised one of our optimal mouse monoclonal anti-human SAP antibodies and clinical testing is currently underway. In 2012 they conducted a Phase 1, Open Label, Dose Characteristic Study to Investigate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of intravenous and subcutaneous doses of CPHPC in patients with systemic amyloidosis (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01406314?term=amyloid+gsk&amp;rank=4), enabling progression to a single dose first in human study of anti-SAP antibodies co-administered with CPHPC in patients with systemic amyloidosis, which is currently underway http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01777243?term=amyloid+gsk&amp;rank=2. Meanwhile our original patent applications, licensed to GSK for this programme, are progressing and GSK are filing new patents as the work proceeds.","Combination currently in clinical trials with very encouraging results and a first publication being prepared for submission.

'The situation with the milk ELISA presents a strong and specific example of tangible benefits these projects bring back to GB. There is some concern in GB that the ever increasing number of animals contributing to bulk milk samples presents a risk that individual infected animals will not be detected. The best way to study this is to try the milk ELISA in a situation where brucellosis is present in some herds and where we can test individual milk samples (and sera ideally) for the animals contributing to the bulk tank. This is clearly not possible in the UK but will be achieved through the ZELS project. Additionally, a redesign of the milk ELISA aimed at increasing sensitivity and robustness whilst maintaining specificity that will directly address the concerns related to the sensitivity of the surveillance of the GB dairy can now be evaluated in the field though the ZELS project as described.'","Further enhanced the collaboration with FADH BBSRC- Indian Department of Biotechnology initiative who are using the same techniques.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=56e031f75a1664.22297853&grantRef=BB%2FL019078%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/L019078/1","5F0340C1-8924-4C25-8491-61346E91F6D6","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","1AB05DA1-4DD6-4843-B416-D7D9441EBFFB","1F2CC7E7-A3C8-444C-987A-EE3C854A986F"

The FARSITE software provides a safe, convenient and effective way for the GP to control the recruitment of their patients into clinical research, whilst allowing NHS-based researchers to run complex and powerful searches over anonymised population level health record data.

Since November 2013 FARSITE has been utilised for a number of research projects covering new disease areas such as vasculitis, and supporting recruitment to a range of clinical projects.

The Farr funded rollout of FARSITE has continued at pace throughout 2014/15. This partnership with stakeholders across the North's Academic Health Science Networks (AHSN) is a direct result of investment from the Farr Institute Capital award enabling clinical research networks and AHSN teams to utilise the FARSITE platform for service improvement and efficient trial recruitment.","The FARSITE platform for rapid feasibility analysis and recruitment in clinical trials was extended by adding new functionality from research in HeRC on care pathway analysis, which was presented and won a distinguished paper prize at Medinfo 2013 (world's top Health Informatics conference). The prototype software, COCPIT, is being incorporated into FARSITE in consultation with NHS users by North West eHealth.

R4-RA is a biopsy-driven, multicentre, international, open-label randomised controlled trial. 
This trial will aim to develop a diagnostic tool (immunohistochemical analysis of synovial tissue) for patient stratification into responsive / non-responsive categories with respect to Rituximab therapy in patients who have had an inadequate response to anti-TNF therapy. Specifically, it aims to determine whether a diagnostic synovial biopsy showing a B-cell &quot;rich/poor pathotype&quot; defines specific disease responsive/resistant subsets for patient stratification and helps rationalize biologic drug choice.

Patients will undergo a synovial biopsy which will stratify them in to 3 pathotype groups (B Cell Poor, B Cell Rich, Germinal Centres (GC) Rich) according to the B-cell score from the biopsy tissues, and in each stratum they will be randomised into two therapeutic arms, Rituximab and Tocilizumab (1:1). Primary Endpoint is treatment response assessed using the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at 16 weeks. Patients deemed treatment failures at 16 weeks will be switched to the other therapeutic option. The trial involves 48 weeks treatment period, followed by further 48 weeks follow-up period. 

Both Rituximab and Tocilizumab have marketing authorisation. Whilst Rituximab is a NICE approved treatment option for patients following anti-TNF therapy, Tocilizumab is not currently a NICE approved pathway.
The trial is funded by NIHR EME Programme.","The significant impact is expected from the outcome of this trial, which has a potential to change clinical practice and therapeutic algorithms for biologic therapies in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

This trial aims to develop of a diagnostic synovial tissue biopsy for patient stratification into responsive / non-responsive categories (treatment algorithm) to the depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody: Rituximab (RTX).
As approximately half of the RA patients have very few B-cells in the joint, the hypothesis of this trial is that these patients are less likely to respond to RTX and that, by examining a small piece of synovial tissue (biopsy) for the presence or absence of B cells prior to treatment with RTX, clinicians will be able to predict likelihood of response and inform drug choice. 

This would: a) provide better care by preventing delay in starting a potentially more effective biologic drug; b) prevent unnecessary exposure to a potentially seriously toxic drug such as RTX and c) avoid wasting &pound;6-8 million to the NHS.

The development of the technology may also lead to protectable IP.

In addition, transcriptomic and next generation sequencing analysis may lead to the identification of specific pathways, &quot;known or unknown&quot;, associated with clinical response to therapeutic intervention with biologic agents. The discovery of such pathways would lead to patentable inventions.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=547daded45c648.68532133&grantRef=G0800648","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0800648","B4A247B0-F984-42E3-A0E4-8869B56292AB","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","81E455DE-3436-49A5-B2A8-B6ABDCB8D837"

There are currently no clinical treatments which directly target amyloid deposits for elimination. The Pepys team first identified and validated human serum amyloid P component (SAP) as a therapeutic target in amyloidosis in the mid 1990s. In vitro, SAP both enhances amyloid fibril formation and protects amyloid fibrils from proteolytic degradation by macrophages. In collaboration with Roche they developed the novel palindromic bis-D-proline compound (R)-1-[6-[(R)-2-Carboxy-Pyrrolidin-1-yl]-6-oxo-Hexanoyl]Pyrrolidine-2-Carboxylic acid (CPHPC), which was intended to prevent SAP from binding to amyloid fibrils in vivo and dissociate bound SAP from amyloid deposits (Nature 2002). CPHPC is avidly bound by human SAP in a complex composed of two native pentameric SAP molecules cross linked by 5 bivalent CPHPC molecules. The complex is perceived as abnormal by the liver and instantly cleared, leading to profound depletion of SAP from the circulation which persists for as long as the drug is administered (PNAS 2009). Targeted depletion of a pathogenic protein by a small molecule drug constitutes a potent, novel pharmacological mechanism. The depletion of plasma SAP also clears most of the SAP from amyloid deposits but the affinity of SAP for CPHPC is insufficient to produce complete dissociation of all SAP from amyloid deposits in the face of the continuous production of 50-100 mg of new SAP per day and the avid binding of SAP to amyloid fibrils. CPHPC is well tolerated by patients and has been administered to more than 60 subjects for a total of more than 50 patient years without any adverse effects. But up to about 10% of the amyloid associated SAP remains in major visceral amyloid deposits even after months of continuous CPHPC treatment. Nevertheless we have not observed any new amyloid accumulation in patients on CPHPC, even those in whom there was progressive deposition before and after CPHPC exposure. Furthermore there were encouraging signs of prolonged renal and possibly patient survival in subjects receiving CPHPC. However we have not detected any amyloid regression. Thus while CPHPC may be a useful adjunct to other therapy for amyloidosis it does not itself promote elimination of the deposits. Pentraxin acquired full ownership of CPHPC from Roche in December 2008.
The capacity of CPHPC to clear essentially all SAP from the circulation, while leaving significant amounts of SAP specifically bound in the amyloid deposits, suggested the possibility of using the residual SAP as an amyloid-specific target for antibodies which can invoke physiological clearance of amyloid from the tissues. Depletion of circulating SAP crucially allows such antibodies to be administered safely and effectively. This approach is unrelated to the function of SAP itself and simply uses SAP as a passive amyloid-specific target. It has been remarkably successful in experimental models (Nature 2010) and should be applicable to all forms of amyloidosis although its safety and efficacy, especially for amyloid in different organs and tissues, will have to be, and is being, carefully evaluated. GlaxoSmithKline licensed the invention of this first in class combination of a small molecule drug and a monoclonal antibody from Pentraxin in February 2009. They have already fully humanised one of our optimal mouse monoclonal anti-human SAP antibodies and clinical testing is currently underway. In 2012 they conducted a Phase 1, Open Label, Dose Characteristic Study to Investigate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of intravenous and subcutaneous doses of CPHPC in patients with systemic amyloidosis (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01406314?term=amyloid+gsk&amp;rank=4), enabling progression to a single dose first in human study of anti-SAP antibodies co-administered with CPHPC in patients with systemic amyloidosis, which is currently underway http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01777243?term=amyloid+gsk&amp;rank=2. Meanwhile our original patent applications, licensed to GSK for this programme, are progressing and GSK are filing new patents as the work proceeds.","Combination currently in clinical trials with very encouraging results and a first publication being prepared for submission.

This condition is typically treated by patching one eye, forcing children to use their amblyopic eye.

Our treatment uses consumer 3D shutter glasses to actively control the balance of inputs to the two eyes and thus encourage the combination of information from the two eyes. We hope this will treat the whole condition, rather than simply the acuity deficits of amblyopia.

In addition to generating unique longitudinal data on the morbidity of, and immunity to, schistosomiasis, this programme provided data and training, which increased Ugandan operational capacity.

Our collaborative studies with the Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory (DBL) and, in South-South collaboration, with the Ministry of Health of neighbouring Kenya, through it's Division of Vector Borne Diseases (DVBD) and Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) helped rebuild VCD's capacity in applied research and control.

metabolic and bone adverse effects. We have identified endogenous anti-inflammatory
glucocorticoids which lack some adverse effects. The lead compound is 5a-
tetrahydrocorticosterone (5aTHB). We now aim to evaluate its efficacy in further models of
inflammation and to detail its side-effect profile. More comprehensive proof-of-principle data
will unlock follow-on funding to support &quot;first in man&quot; studies and optimise the lead drug,
initially for topical use in skin disease.
Specifically, 5aTHB will be studied:
1) Anti-inflammatory efficacy will be compared with hydrocortisone in murine models of
skin inflammation and arthritis.
2) Pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed in mice.
3) Metabolic, skin and bone toxicities will be compared to hydrocortisone at equivalent antiinflammatory
doses in mice.
Results will determine the potential of 5aTHB as topical and/or systemic therapy as a safer
alternative to current first line therapy with conventional glucocorticoids.

Gay men are randomised to have access to daily oral Truvada at enrolment or after one year of follow-up, and all participants have access to the standard prevention package throughout.

Truvada as PrEP has been licensed as PrEP in the USA and this is a pilot study.

Funding provided through: MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Public Health England, and Gilead Sciences. 

544 study participants currently in active follow up.

The PROUD trial reported at the Conference for Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), February 2015 http://www.croiwebcasts.org/console/player/25539?mediaType=audio&amp;","PROUD was a game changer for PrEP for two reasons. Firstly Truvada was more effective at preventing HIV in this open-label pilot phase than in previously reported placebo-controlled trials, and secondly the trial schedule mirrored routine practice with quarterly visits, whereas previous trials had followed a monthly schedule. The study was conducted in men who have sex with men (MSM) attending sexual health clinics in England. When PROUD announced the decision to offer PrEP to those whose access was deferred, IPERGAY asked their Data Monitoring Committee to advise them what to do in their placebo-controlled trial which was also being conducted in MSM, in France. It transpired that Truvada was equally effective when MSM were advised to take drug before and after sex. This caused tremendous excitement when the results were presented back to back at an international conference, and the excitement sparked enthusiasm across Europe.

In November 2015 the French regulatory authority approved the use of Truvada as PrEP on a named patient basis, and the French Minister of Health announced at the end of the same month that the costs of the drug would be fully reimbursed by the social security system. NHS England is about to issue a Commissioning Policy for public consultation.","http://www.proud.mrc.ac.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=NdjYsZQiRyt&grantRef=MC_UU_12023%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_UU_12023/1","334596F1-9665-4B5E-8CDA-B21F92E192CF","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","7E3C0045-B615-48B0-B761-74896FEED7ED"

Even if complete elimination of the immunosuppressants was not possible, lowering the doses of each drug might be expected to benefit patients by potentially reducing the above mentioned risks. However the benefits of minimizing immunosuppression must be weighed against the risks of precipitating acute rejection or propagating chronic transplant dysfunction.

Drugs that reduce platelet function are used to reduce the incidence of such events; however they can also increase risk of bleeding. We have an established track record in developing and using tests of platelet function in diagnosis and for monitoring effects of drug therapy, and as new anti-platelet drugs come on the market, there is a growing demand for such tests. Current tests are timeconsuming, technically demanding or use expensive equipment that is not readily available. Recent progress in our laboratory is such that we now have a simplified test that, with further development, could be used in a wide range of settings. The aim of this application is a) to simplify the test further in collaboration with an industrial collaborator; and b) set up clinical trials to assess its value in a range of different clinical scenarios.

However, the extent to which similar behavioural abnormalities arise from common neural causes across this range of disorders remains unknown, limiting the scope for precise diagnoses and subsequent targeted treatments. As an entry point to this fundamental problem we will focus on response inhibition, a core component of frontal functioning, and combine behavioural testing in the Stop Signal Reaction Time Task with electrophysiological recordings in both human and mouse models with the aim of establishing sensitive and selective translational measures of frontal cortical function and dysfunction. These informative biomarkers have the potential to make an important contribution to accurate and consistent diagnoses and development of therapies targeted according to defined individual cognitive phenotypes in patients.

Non-clinical","",,"2011","Under active development/distribution","This proposal seeks funding to develop in house leads against metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC), using modern medicinal chemistry, molecular modelling, and genetically defined invasive tumours arising autocthanously in transgenic mice. Using our established ProTide platform for the intracellular delivery of bioactive nucleotides, a 2nd generation family of agents related to the 1st generation MCRC drug thymectacin has been prepared. The funding will support the use of medicinal chemistry methods to develop these hits towards leads, aided by extensive local support and expertise particularly in the provision of appropriate transgenic mice and other sophisticated in vivo models of clinical relevance. Molecular modelling methodologies such as docking and 3D-QSAR, and exploiting the local high performance computing and visualisation facility will aid rational candidate selection. We will use our established in house high field multi-nuclear NMR-based screens for plasma stability, acid stability (for oral dosing), and metabolism in target and non-target tissue as potential predictors of in vivo exposure and efficacy/potency. The successful transitioning of leads tto early development will be established through potential license deals and/or research collaboration with leading commercial partners in the field, following business models that have been successful in these laboratories.
70 New chemical entities (protides) have been sythesised and tested to select lead compounds for animal testing

It provides a unique opportunity to intervene on friendship groups of women who drink together. The approach enables participants to support each other through the behaviour change process. The intervention was carefully designed to embed a theoretical behaviour change strategy (based on the Health Action Process Approach) within fun activities that young women enjoy. The use of a motivational interviewing approach fostered high levels of engagement with intervention components. This ensured that participants remained interested and committed to the study.

The current funding from NPRI (Phase 4) was used to develop the intervention and test its acceptability with the target group (young women who binge drink).

To achieve this we are developing the use of a novel bipartite coincidence biodetector created from two recombinant proteins, which drive the coincidence detection event. Both recombinant proteins are made up of a combination of two modular domains (recognition module and detection module) which are expressed in frame with a linker and simply purified as recombinant fusions from bacteria.
To achieve high specificity of recognition, the 'recognition modules' detect target molecules and/or their post-translational modifications. To generate specific readout signals we are exploiting DNA Binding Domains (DBDs) ('detection modules') of nuclear receptors (NRs) which bind specifically to their cognate DNA binding sites as obligate heterodimers. As a result, the signal is generated only when the two recognition modules bind their specific epitopes in close proximity.

Novel methods of measurement developed by Marek Czosnyka, Peter Hutchinson, David Menon and John Pickard have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of brain injury, led to commercial applications, and influenced patient care in terms of improved outcome for clinical trials. Multimodality brain monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP), brain oxygen and microdialysis; PET/MRI imaging of critically ill patients; and computerised CSF infusion tests for shunt function in hydrocephalus have each impacted on the clinical practice and the ability to evaluate novel treatments and interventions in brain injury. This work has led directly to the establishment of a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Cooperative for Brain Injury.
Underpinning research
In 1991 a research group was established across Departments in the Cambridge University Clinical School to undertake research in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and abnormalities of CSF. The group was led jointly by Marek Czosnyka (Senior Research Associate, 1991; Professor of Brain Physics, from 2013), Peter Hutchinson (Reader in Neurosurgery, 2008-date; NIHR Professor from 2013), David Menon (University Lecturer, 1993; Professor of Anaesthesia, from 2000) and John Pickard (Professor of Neurosurgery, from 1991). Central to the impact has been the introduction of technologies derived from brain physics for real-time measurement of brain function in the context of acute injury. Technology that combines monitoring and imaging techniques has been licensed and has increased understanding of the pathophysiology of TBI and CSF disorders; defined optimal physiological parameters associated with best outcome in clinical trials; and altered the care of patients in the neurosciences intensive care setting nationally and internationally. The research encompasses four domains:
Brain physics: By applying multimodal brain monitoring1 (introduced 1991) novel indices of cerebrovascular physiology have been defined including autoregulation with the following major findings:
• TBI: (1) cerebrovascular pressure reactivity independently associates with outcome; (2) extremes of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) contribute to worse outcome; and (3) optimal CPP is a valid therapeutic target (2012)2
• CSF: (1) non-invasive ICP can be estimated from cerebral blood flow velocity and arterial pressure (2000); (2) normal pressure hydrocephalus results from a dysfunction of CSF dynamics, white matter softening and dysautoregulation with aging (2008); and (3) idiopathic intracranial hypertension can be treated with venous stenting (2002)3","http://www.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk/icm+home","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=PSyUpfnkvjQ&grantRef=G9439390","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G9439390","0DB6ECB0-5821-4DB8-8BC3-2DCCF1258AEF","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","B7296B44-D98A-4E67-8053-E7E99D157D05"

This ability, which first motivated the widespread application of BMP2 in fracture healing and spinal arthrodesis has, more recently, been indicated as one of several serious adverse effects associated with the supra-physiological doses of BMP2 relied upon for clinical efficacy. Key to harnessing BMPs and other agents safely and effectively will be the
ability to localize activity at a target site at substantially reduced doses. Clay (Laponite) nanoparticles can self assemble into gels under physiological conditions and bind growth factors for enhanced and localized efficacy. We have shown the ability to localize and enhance the activity of BMP2 to achieve ectopic bone formation at doses within the sub-microgram per ml range of concentrations sufficient to induce
differentiation of responsive cell populations in vitro and at approximately 3000 fold lower than those employed in clinical practice.

The clinical target is antibody-mediated acute rejection (AMR). This can arise because potential recipients of grafts have pre-existing antibodies against blood group (ABO) or human leukocyte antigens in the donated organ. At least 15% of potential recipients are denied transplantation for this reason and some manifestation of AMR is estimated to occur in 10-15% of renal transplants. AMR involves activation of the classical pathway of the complement system but this system interacts with coagulation pathways so that complement activation and thrombotic consequences go hand in hand. Thrombosis treated with anticoagulants given systemically is associated with a bleeding risk which is generally unacceptable in transplant surgery. Building on a chemical strategy which has been applied successfully to modified complement regulatory molecules, we have prepared novel inhibitors of thrombin which can be anchored to the vascular surface in organs by perfusion prior to transplantation. This permits the graft rather than the recipient patient to be anticoagulated. We have used an animal model of AMR in which sensitised rats rapidly reject transplanted kidneys. Preliminary results with a locally perfused lead compound have suggested that graft survival can be prolonged under conditions that avoid a major risk of bleeding. We are seeking support to validate this conclusion and to investigate if combination with complement inhibitors provides added benefit.

We have demonstrated that heterozygous nonsense mutation in the type II receptor (BMPR-II) for bone morphogenetic proteins, underlie the majority of the inherited and familial forms of PAH (2). The principle aim of this project is to develop a therapy for PAH by promoting translation readthrough of pathogenic nonsense alleles using non-toxic chemical agents. Current systems are not suitable for high-throughput screening, thus we have developed a dual-fluorescence reporter assay. We now seek to enhance the development of this assay and use it to identify small molecules capable of resolving BMPR2 mediated signalling defects. Studies performed in mammalian cells and a mouse model will provide proof of principle for restoration of receptor mediated signalling by demonstrating therapeutic effecacy prior to and following the onset of PAH

Its aim was to develop a screening strategy for prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) using once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS). In May 2010 we published the major outcomes, showing that a single FS screen at age 55-64 reduces CRC incidence by 33% and CRC mortality by 43%; the incidence of distal CRC was reduced by 50%. Moreover, this effect showed no sign of wearing off, even after 11 years of follow-up. In 2010 we obtained funding through the NIHR Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) programme to follow the UKFSST cohort for a further five years (2011-2015). Our current objectives are to continue collecting annual follow-up data on the cohort to address the main aims of the trial. These were to determine the magnitude of effect of a single FS screen on CRC incidence and mortality; the optimum age for a single FS screening exam and the duration of the protective effect of a single FS.","Our research played a critical role in the decision by the government and the UK National Screening Committee (UKNSC) to approve inclusion of once-only FS at age 55 in the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP), and implementation of population screening with FS is based on the methodology we developed.

This research has led to the development of a guided self-help package for treating depression that consists of a workbook and an audio CD with mental exercises focused on thinking about difficulties in a more helpful concrete way. This self-help package is practised daily for 6 weeks, with guidance from a faciliatator consisting of one face-to-face coaching session and then 3 follow-up telephone sessions.","This research has now established proof-of-principle that this approach repeated daily can reduce symptoms of depression. Pilot work in a multiple case series has demonstrated in patients with major depression that is safe, tolerable, and acceptable. The final phase of the MRC grant tested out the efficacy of the intervention in a Phase II small scale controlled trial (n =121), examining whether adding the brief guided self-help treatment to treatment as usual (GP management and, typically, antidepressant medication) produces better treatment outcomes for patients with major depression than treatment as usual alone. The results of the main outcome analysis indicate that the cognitive training guided self-help treatment adds significant clinical benefit in terms of reducing depression relative to treatment-as-usual alone, and that it is of equivalent efficacy to a relaxation based guided self-help treatment in reducing depression, but superior in changing depressogenic thinking such as rumination. This outcome has now been published in Psychological Medicine, a leading psychiatric journal. The project has therefore developed a novel treatment derived from experimental findings that is easily accessible, cost-effective and disseminable, and could be made widely available (for example via Improving Access to Psychological Treatments IAPT initiative or through e-mental health). This treatment material has been copyrighted. This intervention could have a significant impact on potential healthcare provision and policy, by integrating into the low-intensity approach to treatment a novel empirically-validated and cost-effective treatment that explicitly targets a core psychological process (rumination) in depression. There is interest from local NHS mental health services in adopting this treatment and adding it into the low intensity IAPT provision - we are currently planning and examining the means to develop suitable training and dissemination for the therapy. In addition, there is scope to adapt the therapy to be delivered through an internet-based platform and we envisage that this may be a focus of future research. The intervention is also influencing the development of prevention treatments to prevent depression and rumination in at risk adolescents.

Currently, there are no tests capable of predicting response and the mechanisms of non-response remain unknown. This leaves a major unmet need and a considerable health and economic burden. In the UK alone, RA drugs cost the NHS &pound;560 million, while RA total annual economic impact is estimated &pound;4.2 billion (NAO). The THERAPIST study aims to address this major unmet need by exploring the capacity of disease tissue (synovium) and peripheral blood biomarkers to predict response prior to anti-TNFa therapy initiation and to understand the mechanisms of response/nonresponse. In addition THERAPIST will characterise the role of IL17/ Th17 pathway (primary hypothesis) &amp; , through a powerful hypothesis-free discovery investigation, potentially unveil new therapeutic targets. 50 RA patients requiring anti-TNFa therapy after failure of conventional Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs, e.g. methotrexate, according to NICE guidelines, will be recruited to the study following informed consent. Clinical responses will be assessed by standard/validated tools such as 28 tender-swollen joint count integrated into the Disease Activity Score (DAS28), as well as objective ultrasound joint imaging. Biological responses are measured in the disease tissue (synovial biopsy substudy) in 20 patients consenting to an ultrasound-guided, minimally invasive, well-tolerated procedure, as we described (Kelly et al. Ann Rheum Disease 2013) and in peripheral blood of all 50 patients as comparators. The biopsy substudy is essential to provide disease tissue for the proposed investigation, as 30 years of research looking for peripheral blood predictive biomarkers have proven unsuccessful.

For some diseases the immunogens are not known and for others they are difficult and expensive to produce, transport and administer, for example influenza vaccine must be produced in millions of chicken eggs. A very attractive potential solution is to inject the DNA gene encoding the immunogen rather than the immunogen itself. In this process, known as DNA vaccination, the DNA enters cells, predominantly at the site of injection, and causes them to produce the immunogen locally within the body. DNA vaccination works well and stimulates excellent protective immunity against a variety of different infections, and even some cancers, in mice, horses, dogs, rabbits and pigs. But in humans and other primates, and in cows and sheep, the immune response to DNA vaccination is very feeble. Despite enormous academic and pharmaceutical industry efforts, the reasons for this failure have not been understood or overcome. We previously discovered, in work funded by the MRC, that a protein in human plasma, known as serum amyloid P component (SAP), is the only normal plasma protein which binds avidly to DNA. We have now found that, in each of the animal species in which DNA vaccination is effective, this protein is either absent or, if it is present, it binds only weakly to DNA. In contrast, non-human primates, cows and sheep share with humans the presence of SAP proteins which strongly bind to DNA. We believe that binding of DNA by SAP may be responsible for blocking induction of immune responses by DNA and that removal of SAP may overcome this inhibition. SAP contributes to important human diseases, amyloidosis and Alzheimer's disease, and, in MRC funded work towards treatment for these conditions, we have previously developed a drug, CPHPC, which safely removes almost all SAP from the blood in humans. Another laboratory has recently reported that the presence of human SAP inhibits DNA vaccination in mice and that this effect is reversed by our drug, CPHPC. These observations confirm our hypothesis. We are now undertaking the first human clinical study of DNA vaccination after SAP depletion, funded by an MRC DCS award. We will measure the immune responses to HIV-1 in normal adult men, comparing a group in whom SAP has been completely depleted at the time of DNA vaccination and a control group vaccinated without SAP depletion. We predict that SAP depletion at the time of vaccination will enhance the immune response. The DNA vaccine to be tested is a promising new vaccine against HIV-AIDS, developed and manufactured with previous MRC awards. A positive result, consistent with improved protective immunity against HIV-1, will be very encouraging. Furthermore, proof of the concept that SAP depletion can enhance immune responses to DNA vaccination in humans will open up this approach for the many other diseases for which effective vaccination does not yet exist and in which it could have therapeutic as well as prophylactic benefits. Success in the clinical trial undertaken here with an HIV-1 vaccine will establish a critical proof of concept, opening the way to general application of our new approach. The clinical trial has begun. The first two subjects have been successfully screened and randomised and have been admitted to the CRF.

In some aged individuals massive transthyretin amyloid deposition in the heart causes fatal senile cardiac amyloidosis, a condition which is rarely diagnosed but is almost certainly much more prevalent than currently recognised. Most of the &gt;100 rare mutations in the human transthyretin gene increase the amyloidogenicity of the respective variant proteins and cause autosomal dominant adult onset hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, usually presenting as familial amyloid polyneuropathy. There is currently no effective treatment for this uniformly fatal disease. Since transthyretin amyloidogenesis involves misfolding and dissociation of the native tetrameric structure of the protein, a rational therapeutic approach is the use of small molecule ligands which are specifically bound by transthyretin and stabilise its native structure and assembly. Prof Sir Mark Pepys and his research group are developing novel transthyretin superstabiliser compounds in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. The compounds are currently at medicinal chemistry/ early non-clinical testing and refinement stage. As GSK licensed this programme in 2010 they are now the principle source of funding.","The development programme is still at an early stage. Novel transthyretin stabilising compounds have been identified. These are being evaluated and refined for eventual clinical testing.

Clinical","Yes","NCT02053051","2014","Under active development/distribution","This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel advanced bolus calculator in subjects with Type 1 diabetes. Insulin bolus calculators have been developed to aid insulin dose adjustment and existing standard insulin bolus calculator consist of a simple algorithm that requires five subject-specific parameters as input to generate a recommended bolus insulin dose: current blood glucose (mmol/L); target blood glucose (mmol/L); insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (grams of carbohydrate per 1 unit of insulin); total grams of carbohydrate in meals; insulin sensitivity factor (reduction in glucose per 1 unit of insulin).
The Diabetes Technology team at Imperial College have developed a novel advanced bolus calculator. The complete integrated system consists of a commercially available smartphone that holds the novel advanced algorithm. The system requires regular updates of cases derived from retrospective blinded continuous glucose monitoring data and for this a commercially available glucose sensor will be used. Each new case includes information about the problem (e.g. capillary blood glucose, meal information and physical exercise), solution (recommended insulin dose) and outcome (blood glucose following a meal). The novel decision support algorithm is based on case-based reasoning (CBR). CBR is an artificial intelligence technique that tries to solve newly encountered problems by applying the solutions learned from solved problems encountered in the past.
The end-product is therefore a subject specific insulin bolus calculator that continues to improve with time. The project utilises commercially available glucose sensors and smartphones (iPhone), integrated with a novel algorithm for insulin bolus calculation. The aim of the ABC4D is to minimise high and low glucose excursions which are associated with the complications of diabetes including blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage and cardiovascular disease.
The clinical study has been designed to incrementally assess the device's ability to manage meal time insulin requirements at breakfast and lunch in a controlled supervised clinical environment over 8 hours (phase 1), followed by its use in the home environment over a 6 week period (phase 2) and finally over a 6 month period (phase 3).
The most recent principle source of funding has been 'Imperial Confidence in Concept Scheme &amp;
Imperial NIHR Biomedical Research Centre /Imperial Innovations Therapeutic primer fund'. 
The clinical trial (phase 2) is currently active with the available funding. We are currently actively seeking for more funding to carry out the next phase of the clinical trial (phase 3).","Very positive feedback on usability of the ABC4D system was obtained from a focus group carried out with six volunteers with type 1 diabetes.","http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02053051","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=545a5af4c386d4.61982588&grantRef=MC_PC_12015","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_PC_12015","89A994FB-742D-4FAE-9FF5-955CB8D8761E","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","E5AC7F34-4BD1-4120-9F04-E44157ED4C2E"

Consultations based on the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change involved a 20-30 minute, one-to-one discussion incorporating stage specific, evidence based strategies to strengthen motivation, provided education and developed realistic PA goals. Silver level Stage 2 (month 2) Dietary (Fruit and Vegetable focus) counselling to achieve small, achievable changes and to demonstrate weight maintenance/weight loss added to PA goals Interventions were face to face, tailored to the individual, with personalised specific advice, and setting of short (1 mth) and long-term goals (3 months). Gold level Stage 3 (month 3) Weight management counselling to initiate (or encourage further) weight loss and maintenance at end of 3 months were added to stages 1 and 2. 

Since the Healthforce study's completion, the intervention is now undergoing further development and adaptation for a minimal contact randomised controlled trial in the same CVD screening population. This is being carried as a PhD study where the Healthforce intervention will be adapted to become minimum contact (telephone and mailed communication rather than face to face) and compared with a brief single intervention (10 minutes) delivered at the end of the CVD screening visit. Funding has been obtained from the Institute of Cardiovascular Research (TICR) for this work.","Participants appreciated personalised assessment approaches, especially those who were worried about CVD risk (an opportunity for intervention at a teachable moment). The supportive approach by research staff was noted and may reflect the shared benefits e.g. for participant health and research understanding. The organisation of information, structured approaches, self monitoring (for personal and research purposes) and practical intervention materials were noted and recognised to be beyond previous personal efforts. 

Whilst this interventiion is currently undergoing further development as part of the aforementioned PhD study, the approach of delivering the intervention over 3 months via monthly consultations has also been utillised in two further target populations. The MRC funded WeighWell feasibility study completed in 2010 was successful in promoting weight loss in postpartum women and it is intended that further funding will be sought to investigate this further via an RCT. The ongoing NPRI funded BeWEL study targeting colorectal cancer screening participants is also utilising this approach, but extending the intervention period to 12 months utilising telephone and mailed contact following the initial 3 month consultation period.","http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN38976321","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=E1834893DFE&grantRef=G0501273","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0501273","09AFCEF7-A733-4C70-B5F0-B9C2F2494C4B","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","90051600-6EF2-4093-BA8C-2B4B6F550895","2D8F431F-F6D7-48FF-819A-C9FF6374C5EF"

Primary objectives: 
1. To examine, in a randomised controlled trial, whether the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide (IE) to post-operative chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin and methotrexate improves event-free survival for patients with resectable osteosarcoma and a poor histological response to 10 weeks of pre-operative chemotherapy. 
2. To examine, in a randomised controlled trial, whether the addition of interferon-alpha ifn) as maintenance therapy after post-operative chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin and methotrexate improves event-free survival for patients with resectable osteosarcoma and a good histological response to 10 weeks of pre-operative chemotherapy. 

Secondary objectives: 
3. To investigate whether the addition of IE to post-operative therapy for poor responders, and the addition of ifn as maintenance therapy for good responders, leads to an improvement in overall survival, short-term toxicity, long-term toxicity and quality of life. 
4. To investigate whether the addition of IE to post-operative therapy for poor responders, and the addition of ifn as maintenance therapy for good responders, leads to an improvement in event-free and overall survival in patients with localized osteosarcoma at entry. 
5. To investigate whether biological or clinical correlates to histological response and outcome can be identified. 
6. To establish whether this international cooperation in clinical trials for osteosarcoma is feasible. 

The trial is currently in follow-up. Results of the primary analysis (for event-free survival) of the good responders randomisation have been presented but active follow-up continues for the poor responders primary outcome measure and all secondary outcome measures.

In each intervention factory, several team leaders were selected from the migrant workers and were trained to conduct the 5A smoking cessation intervention and follow-up within their teams. 
Other supportive interventions include public health education lectures, posters/leaflets and social medias.","At individual level, participants(i.e., migrant workers) have improved their knowledge of tobacco hazards, benefits and methods of smoking cessation. They have also reduced second hand smoking contact, and encouraged their workmates around them to quit. Our initial analysis shows that, a total of 51 workers in the intervention group have taken action to quit smoking, accounting for 71.8% of smoking participants, and 20(39%) of them have successfully stopped smoking. The smoking rate has been reduced from 51.2% to 46.6% in intervention group.
At the factory level, improvement of workers' tobacco control awareness has facilitated the development and implementation of tobacco-free factory regulations. Evidence shows that the tobacco-free regulations have long lasting effects to reduce the smoking rate among workers and smoking intensity of those smokers. 
At the policy level, the piloting processes have improved the awareness of local health system to implement the smoking cessation activities among the factories. 
At the academic level, this project has improved the capacity of conducting intervention research , and enriched our portfolio of migrant health research.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=56de959f773b90.68922437&grantRef=MR%2FM021513%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/M021513/1","025A32C9-D3A5-4FCC-B5EC-9EEA3176C980","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","5A638CD5-2C73-4056-B703-F711C9E0F970","4155100F-AEA2-478D-A734-6AC7685DE4E4"

ACTs are now the standard for treatment of P.falciparum malaria in non-pregnant individuals and in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, including in Indonesia, where DHP is now first line treatment in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy in malaria endemic areas.
Globally, there is now considerable experience with artemisinin derivatives in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of ACTs for the treatment of malaria in non-pregnant adults and children conducted to inform the 2nd edition of the malaria treatment guidelines by WHO, showed that DHP is very effective and provides long durations of post-treatment prophylaxis similar to mefloquine and longer durations than amodiaquine (AQ-artesunate, or AQ-SP), artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem&reg;) based antimalarial combinations.
A GMP formulation of DHP has recently become available as Eurartesim, manufactured by Sigma-Tau, Italy and approved in October 2011 by the European Medicine Agency (EMEA) for treatment of malaria","The primary purpose of the trial is to inform policy makers on selecting suitable interventions for the prevention of malaria at national, regional and global levels. Indonesia has extensive experience with DHP, and is the first country to have made DHP the treatment of choice in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Indonesia is also the first country to introduce screening as the national MiP policy as part of antenatal care. In these settings ISTp with DHP is therefore a logical extension of the existing SSTp strategy. Because the large Island nation of Indonesia has one of the most diverse malaria epidemiology globally, a one-size-fits-all policy (as currently recommended for Africa), will not be appropriate for Indonesia. Information on both new interventions (ISTp and IPTp) is therefore needed; e.g. IPTp may be considered in the low-medium transmission intensity regions, such as parts of Papua, whereas ISTp may be the better option in lower transmission areas and SSTp in areas with the lowest transmission. 
Indonesia has been a regional pioneer with the development of its current SSTp strategy to control MiP and thus the data of this proposed trial would have relevance to other Asian countries in deciding on MiP control programmes. This study, together with two other ongoing prevention trials in India and Papua New Guinea (PNG), will potentially have important policy implications for most malaria endemic countries in Asia and possibly Latin America.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=Rof8KUwjupz&grantRef=G1100654","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G1100654","038EAE39-7008-495A-8A1C-E4910682EAAD","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3ED60B49-9C2B-4D71-B644-96CCC7F10194","F13BF253-1BAD-4098-906D-34C670DD7256"

Novel CRP inhibitor compounds are currently in pre-clinical development. After extensive evaluation the original compound, BPC8, for the development of which the DCS award was given in 2010, was found not be optimal for further development. In 2012 the MRC awarded Sir Mark additional funds for a back up chemistry programme to rationally design and synthesise new candidate molecules drawing on the results so far with BPC8. This programme continues and two promising candidate molecules are currently being synthesised by a CRO. In a progress report to the MRC Sir Mark described the novel molecules which have been designed, synthesised and tested so far. Unsurprisingly for such a novel programme none evaluated so far have been optimal for development, however the results of these evaluations have provided important knowledge for the design of subsequent compounds. Two promising compounds are currently being synthesised by a CRO and are due for delivery early November. Unfortunately the MRC have deemed the programme to now be too different from the original plan and have decided to terminate the award. A termination plan has been submitted and we await approval. In the meantime evaluation of the newest compounds will continue with a view to seeking further funds if one or more of these should prove worthy of full scale pre-clinical evaluation.","The work was published in Nature in 2006 and was the subject of the cover illustration and additional material in the journal.

The LLIN can withstand repeated washing and retains efficacy over years of use. Olyset net is a long established LLIN that contains permethrin but no synergist. Both LLINs are approved by WHOPES and registered in Tanzania. In experimental hut trials in West Africa, Olyset Plus killed twice as many resistant mosquitoes and reduced biting rates by one third as compared to Olyset. On exposure to the two types of LLIN for 3 minutes none of the An. gambiae mosquitoes collected from Muleba was killed by the conventional Olyset but all were killed by Olyset Plus (Protopopoff unpublished). This indicates the type of resistance occurring in Muleba can be synergised by the PBO on Olyset Plus.","This new LLIN has the potential to restore control of malaria transmitted by resistant mosquito populations.","http://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Firis%2Fbitstream%2F10665%2F75304%2F1%2F9789241504089_eng.pdf&ei=CyxjVOPiBsvgOIesgLgF&usg=AFQjCNFiWOzcRGMutrmRtlmn-E3IoPdOJw&bvm=bv.79189006,d.ZWU","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=54632c2fc9dfd7.93610763&grantRef=MR%2FL004437%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/L004437/1","BB989A53-FCE2-4132-87E3-BE934728E0AB","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","055EA8B7-2C66-4FF5-96DD-63FA3AA7D0B7","984899A5-5C1C-4581-A2B9-C56A4F5092B7"

Our technology is different and advantageous compared to any conventional materials used which have poor osseointegration values (~45%) and remodeling rates (2-3 years).

We have competed in-vitro testing and developed a number of compositions which we are taking to animal in-vivo stage. A pre-clinical pilot in-vivo study has been planned to begin in February. This will be a four animal miniature pig study performing alveolar socket grafting, to be performed in Sweden, using six test materials and two control materials. The results of this will be used to refine which composition to take forward for further pre-clinical in-vivo testing. Secondly the results will be used to provide figures to base statistical significance upon for future animal in-vivo studies. We will measure osseointegration as bone-to-graft contact and remodeling rates using fluorochrome labels.

In kidney transplantation, the important antibodies are blood group (ABO) and tissue type (HLA). We would like to measure the antibody strength (titre) of ABO-blood group antibodies for renal failure patients on the deceased donor waiting list. These ABO-blood group antibodies vary between people which is why we want to measure them in a large number of patients. We would also like to know if these antibody levels and other cells associated with the antibody response change with time which is why we plan to test them at 0, 6 &amp; 12 months. At the moment, we measure antibody levels to different tissue types (HLA) for patients on the deceased donor list every 3 months, and we would time these tests to coincide as we would like to know if the strength of blood group (ABO) antibodies is in any way related to the strength of tissue type (HLA) antibodies. We don't routinely test ABO-blood group antibody strength unless a patient is having a live donor blood group incompatible transplant. This kind of transplant requires antibody removal before the transplant can go ahead safely. For some patients with weak (titre) blood group antibodies it is possible to have a transplant without antibody removal. ABO blood group incompatible transplantation from a deceased donor is not normally performed. We hope that by doing this study, we will identify how many patients have weak enough blood group antibodies to allow a blood group incompatible transplant without needing antibody removal. This might mean that they could be listed to accept more kidneys, which might make a deceased donor transplant more likely.","n/a","http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/Search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=14694","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=aEK1xKiNWWJ&grantRef=MR%2FJ006742%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/J006742/1","5C9020B5-5161-48B8-BD61-E87E2A3C904C","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","318B5D98-4CB4-4B10-A876-08FC93071A56","893D66CD-2721-4DA1-BC08-7050127B4B3A"

Unfortunately, only minor progress has been made in improving their potential and enabling them to overcome mammalian cellular barriers. We hypothesized that one of the limitations of phage is its surface negative charge, which could hinder its access to negatively charged eukaryotic cell membranes and subsequent binding to the target cell receptor. Therefore, we generated a novel hybrid system consisting of two classes of nanomaterial systems, cationic polymers and the M13 bacteriophage virus particles genetically engineered to display a tumor targeting ligand and to carry a transgene cassette. We show that complexation of phage with cationic polymers generates positively charged phage which show enhanced cell surface attachment and improved transgene expression while retaining cell type specificity. Moreover, phage/polymer complexes carrying a therapeutic gene achieve greater targeted cancer cell killing than phage alone.
