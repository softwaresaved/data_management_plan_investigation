Repentir recognises the position and orientation of a specific painting within a photograph and precisely overlays images that were captured during that painting's creation. The viewer may then browse through the work's multiple states and closely examine its painted surface in one of two ways: scrolling or rubbing. Repentir enables the viewer to explore intermediary stages in the painting's development and see what is usually lost within the materially additive painting process. Repentir offers an innovative approach to digital reproduction and provides users with unique insights into the painter's working method.","Software","","2012","The app was featured in several major art exhibitions and attracted media attention","https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/repentir-transamerica/id603560368?mt=8","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5462289bbff709.98905746&grantRef=EP%2FI032088%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I032088/1","E14657F4-51F3-409E-9304-14CA846E3602","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","EF390CF0-ECD3-47D8-B9A8-7602AF319BEE","547506FD-37CC-4F4E-B4CB-ED622242A07A"

A considerable amount of research was put into lexical disambiguation of the biomedical names. This is because a string of words often refers to different meanings depending on the context, hence causing ambiguity. A more sensible way to organise information is by concepts, where a concept has unambiguous meaning and can be associated with a unique identifier. We carry out organism disambiguation by automatically identifying the species-indicating words (e.g., human) and biomedical named entities (e.g., protein P53) in text, and then judging whether the species-entity relations are positive, where a positive relation means that an entity belongs to the organism indicated by the species-indicating word.","Webtool/Application","","2008","This tool tackled one major source of ambiguity in entity mentions: model organisms. Model organisms are species studied to understand particular biological phenomena. Biological experiments are often conducted on one species, with the expectation that the discoveries will provide insight into the workings of others, including humans, which are more difficult to study directly. From viruses, prokaryotes, to plants and animals, there are dozens of organisms commonly used in biological studies, such as E. coli, C. elegans, Drosophila, Homo sapiens, and hundreds more are frequently mentioned in biological research papers. Given an article, it is often essential for readers to understand what organisms the biomedical entities (e.g., proteins) belong to, and on what organisms the experiments were carried out.","http://www.nactem.ac.uk/deca_details/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=545cf5a2af8c84.48591419&grantRef=BB%2FG013160%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/G013160/1","13B8B29D-10FE-44BD-BAE7-17D4B7E14EDC","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","EF173542-4829-481A-AAD5-D3F1B64500C2"

This yields the spatially integrated electron spectra of a coronal source from less than 0.1 keV up to several tens of keV. The results show that the total energy can only be determined accurately by combining RHESSI and AIA observations. Simultaneously fitting the proposed representation of the kappa-distribution reduces the electron number density in the analyzed flare by a factor of ~30 and the total flare energy by a factor of ~5 compared with the commonly used fitting of RHESSI spectra.

A 2 day delay before composite construction is typical in forensic investigations, and we suggested that applying this technique as standard is likely to be advantageous. Further, we also demonstrated the combined effectiveness of the Holistic-Cognitive Interview technique and perceptual stretch for both a feature-based (PRO-fit) and holistic-based (EvoFIT) system. This benefit of perceptual stretch has now been independently shown to generalise to two alternative composite systems (EFIT-V, a holistic system and E-FIT a feature-based system) by an alternative laboratory (Davis, 2015, Journal of Forensic Practice). However, feedback we gathered from individual operators expressed concern that publicising this technique may invite ridicule and undermine public engagement. Therefore a Perceptual Backdrop Image was created. This presents a composite image against a perceptual backdrop so that it can be presented directly to the viewer, without asking them to angle the composite. It has the same effect on the visual appearance of the image as physically turning the composite to the side. Software has been developed to allow a perceptual backdrop image to be produced as a standard output from EvoFIT and the same effect can easily be achieved using Photoshop for composites generated with other composite systems (e.g., PRO-Fit, EFIT-V, E-FIT). This has proved more acceptable to composite operators. Using a perceptual backdrop also ensures that the perceptual effect we are striving for is maintained (and the image is not altered) when images are published by alternative outlets other than the police (e.g., in newspapers).","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2012","The Police Service of Northern Ireland have been using the Perceptual Backdrop Image extensively when circulating composites for identification both within and external to their force. However, in spite of the benefits some forces are still expressing the concern that it seems too unusual. We have discussed alternatives with police operatives who think it would be acceptable to include the technique as part of a sequence of representations that should help recognition. These include caricature, Gaussian blue and contrast enhancement, all found in past research to improve recognition rates. We have provided a short guide for police operatives outlining use of the Perceptual Backdrop Image format which is publically available at the following link: http://www.evofit.co.uk/training-support/.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56d998ee310555.20201041&grantRef=ES%2FI002022%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=ES/I002022/1","DBFA85A0-54B2-41B1-8802-EED5784E4F4B","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","6446B67E-9CA1-46B3-8BCE-3090A3BD4A44"

Bite plates are vacuum-moulded around standard templates. When placed in the mouth at the beginning of an ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) recording session, and gripped between the teeth, a flat surface corresponding to the speaker's occlusal plane is imaged. The occlusal plane (or &quot;bite plane&quot;) trace can be recorded as a reference marker to allow the reorientation of subsequently recorded tongue images. It allows the standardisation of probe-to-cranium angle across speakers. As the distance between the vertical protrusion (that sits in front of the upper incisors) to the back of the bite plate is known, it provides another way to quantify distance in the ultrasound image.","Physical Model/Kit","","2011","The bite plate improves the interpretability of ultrasound tongue images by showing the quasi-horizontal position of the head.

Different correction methods are applied today based on auxiliary data, including GNSS, weather models (e.g. ECMWF ERA-I, WRF, NARR, etc), spectrometer data (MERIS and MODIS), or combinations of different sources. Alternative methods exist to estimate the tropospheric delays from the radar data themselves. The success rate of the different techniques is dependant on multiple factors like temporal and spatial resolution, cloud cover, signal contamination, local topography, etc.

TRAIN provides a set of MATLAB tools that can be used to correct for tropospheric delays in InSAR data. Once set-up for one correction method, the toolbox allows for easy comparison with other methods, as all are formatted in the same way. The toolbox is fully compatible, but not limited, to the Doris and StaMPS software. Initial debugging has been done for ROI_PAC and PI-rate processed data, but user feedback and reporting will allow for further development. The toolbox includes the correction methods provided below, with a full descriptive manual on the input parameters, and tips/hints in case of problems.","Software","Yes","2015","The software has been downloaded 327 times by groups all over the world.","http://davidbekaert.com/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56e042303f6080.09681394&grantRef=NE%2FK010867%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=NE/K010867/1","8AB7E131-EFC4-40A3-8A7A-DD8506CC8028","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","5C230A92-D6F8-45E7-8735-1553D8A3741B"

Previously the CS team had developed an early network analysis software allowing analysis, manipulation and visualization of generic networked data. The software developed as a part of this project provides a pipeline that conveniently incorporates a number of already used by biologists data processing and analysis mechanisms previously handled manually. More particularly, all elements/features of the pipeline are introduced as additional modules to the existing network analysis/visualization software tool. The main features incorporated into the software include:



- the ability to load data in the form of an Expression Matrix and a ranked list/lists of genes. 

(With options to view and select the required information from these files)



- the automated use of the SOTA: Self Organising Tree Algorithm to cluster the genes provided. 

(the user has control over the input parameters if required)



- gene set enrichment capabilities 

(with user control over input parameters)



- functional annotation of genes and clusters

(with user control over input parameters)



- automated use of ARACNE algorithm to construct networks.

(the user is given the choice of building either a network based on individual genes or the clusters created by the SOTA algorithm)



- various colouring capabilities to aid with cluster visualization in the main window of the software.



- data display windows to enable users to easily click on a gene or cluster in the network and gain access to the data procured from the above features.","Software","","2013","The software produced so far should be seen as a proof of concept.

It performs five common gene expression analysis tasks:

 cross-study normalisation
 feature selection
 sample clustering
 sample classification
 network analysis
 gene set analysis

Unlike other microarray-related servers, ArrayMining is using ensemble and consensus techniques (e.g. ensemble feature selection, ensemble prediction, consensus clustering) and performs automatic parameter selection. For a given analysis task it is possible to combine multiple algorithms and data sets in a semi-automatic fashion. This way new exploratory routes become available, e.g. ensemble sample classification can be performed with predictors obtained from a gene set analysis applied to combined data from multiple studies.

The analysis is further simplified by the integration with annotation databases. This enables further functional analysis and literature mining.

This it can be used to obtain multidimensional fluorescence datasets that provide exquisite contrast between different fluorophores or states of fluorophores. Unlike a microscope, all the emitted photons are collected as a single point measurement (i.e. a homogeneous assay) and the resulting large number of photons is sufficient to enable the analysis of complex decay profiles with spectral and polarisation resolution. This can be applied to acquire excitation-emission-lifetime matrices (or subsets thereof), which can be used to study changes in fluorescence to report on the local molecular environment or it can be used to distinguish different fluorophores - for example using the time resolution to discriminate between fluorophores with similar spectral properties. It can also be used for FRET studies. The capability for time-resolved and polarisation-resolved fluorescence measurements enable time-resolved anisotropy studies, e.g. of molecular rotational dynamics. The instrument is designed for solution-based studies in cuvettes and also can make measurements of remote samples via a fibre-optic probe. After this project finished, it was also modified to enable automated homogenous measurements of samples arrayed in multiwell plates.

The internal supercontinuum source provides excitation from ~ 400 to &gt;800 nm and the instrument has been designed to permit rapid coupling of external excitation sources as required, e.g. u.v. lasers for exciting endogenous fluorescence.

It can be applied to the analysis of traits that adopt a finite number of discrete states, or to the analysis of continuously varying traits. The methods can be used to take into account uncertainty about the model of evolution and the underlying phylogeny","Software","","2014","The new version of BayesTraits can effectively analyse large trees with hundreds or thousands of taxa, for both continuous, discrete and multi state data. Improvements have led to over 3 orders of magnitude speed increase when analysing a near complete bird phylogeny of 6000 taxa, reducing the run time from years to hours. This allows the analysis of current and next generation of phylogenetic trees, as well as the development of more complex and realistic evolutionary models. The new release includes a comprehensive manual, worked examples and supporting technical information.","http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraits.html","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5464ab7d71de50.83880024&grantRef=BB%2FK004344%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/K004344/1","3DE175E7-F29A-45B3-BF67-3ABDEBE9B395","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","E89C3602-0FB4-4044-A918-58966B8A10B2","9B506F22-45D9-4AFD-A49B-5CFAA2D50258"

 a modelling language based on P systems which allows modular and parsimonious multi-cellular model development where the outermost compartments can be positioned in 2-dimensional space to facilitate modelling at either extra-, inter- or intracellular levels of detail

 deterministic and stochastic simulator using algorithms optimised for large multi-compartmental systems (the simulator also accept a subset of SBML, allowing for visual model specification using tools such as CellDesigner)

 formal model analysis for the study of temporal and spatial model properties supported the model checkers PRISM and MC2

What allows the current development/use to be significant is the combination of purpose built research environments and the addition of intensive data collection in real time. As well as offering opportunities for the use of traditional data collection instruments my application of UNITY also allows for continuous monitoring of all activity and for the embedding of data extraction devices that are minimally invasive within the participant's ongoing experience.

There are two aspects to the CG approach that has been undertaken:

1. A fully featured interface has been introduced between DL_POLY and VOTCA, the latter being the well-known nowadays Versatile Object-oriented Toolkit for Coarse-graining Applications (www.votca.org) introduced in 2009 by the theoretical group Prof. Kurt Kremer [J. Chem. Theor. Comp. 2009, vol. 5(12), p. 3211] and now being further developed at UI-UC, University of Cambridge and LANL.

2. A stand-alone tool for CG mapping - DL_CGMAP.

In practice, this means that developers can take existing software tools or libraries and wrap them as software components using the features provided by the libhpc-cf library. These components can then be linked to form more advanced processes by applying coordination forms to them. Coordination forms allow the specification of richer orchestration than traditional workflow languages and the library is extensible to allow the addition of further coordination forms. Coordination forms can vary from basic structures, such as specifying that a set of dependent components are processed sequentially or that a set of independent components may be processed in parallel, to advanced domain specific languages. A further key benefit of both components and coordination forms specified within the libhpc-cf library is that both can have multiple implementations allowing different approaches to be used to undertake a given task depending on the type of target computing platform to be used or the problem being addressed.","Software","Yes","2015","The libhpc-cf library provides a modern Python implementation of a general approach pioneered by Darlington, Guo et al. in their 1995 paper &quot;Functional Skeletons for Parallel Coordination&quot;. The library offers a demonstration of the differences and power of coordination forms when compared to existing workflow languages or systems. The ability to handle multiple implementations of software components and the orchestration processes used to control them is of particular use in modern heterogeneous computing environments.","https://github.com/london-escience/libhpc-cf","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56cf7febd7c5d6.01783290&grantRef=EP%2FI030239%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I030239/1","7A59D68A-0297-45AF-8F7D-07061A3798FD","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","78705635-40B1-4C4E-9E7D-9AE59DC55CB1"

It provides basic software components (e.g., appliances, generators and storage) that can be assembled together to build general models of smart homes and communities. These components can be extended to construct specialised models to meet the specific needs of any particular project. This approach enables rapid, bottom-up modelling of smart homes and communities with resuable models and components. The SHF emphasises on reusability which we believe will eventually lead to standardised models of appliances (e.g., washing machines, ovens, fridges), smart homes and smart communities that can be made available online for all.","Webtool/Application","","2013","In a nutshell, the framework contains the code for modelling smart homes and communities.

The tool, developed in collaboration with project partners, can be applied in intervention studies, for comparison within the same organisation (e.g. before and after an energy saving campaign), as well as for benchmarking against the performance of similar organisations - provided that sufficient benchmarking data has been collected. It is anticipated that the tool will be used not only as a research tool, but also as a consultancy opportunity for advising factories and office-based companies of their user-dependent energy-saving potential (IPR and commercialisation routes to be discussed at the end of overall project). 

An academic paper on the benchmarking tool will be submitted shortly to a relevant scientific journal.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2011","This is a questionnaire survey.

on the likelihood of functionality. This method is particularly good at prioritising functional noncoding

Then you can use several tools that make correction of such errors a breeze, including alternative pitch track selection, octave shift, and easy note split, merge and deletion.

Finally, you can export pitch track and note track in .csv (comma-separated values) format, or simply save a session file to continue annotating another time.","Software","Yes","2014","Has supported development and publication of an annotated multi-track test audio dataset, and is likely to be used in future work of this kind.","https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/tony","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5463a0759a1914.43685275&grantRef=EP%2FH043101%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H043101/1","6E9FAB73-85BA-469D-88C0-1AEBEB07B849","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","DB9B029E-6575-4ABC-A08F-ED21A698645B"

 FABM enables complex biogeochemical models to be developed as sets of stand-alone, process-specific modules. These can be combined at runtime to create custom-tailored models. This approach has been adopted to implement several large ecosystem models in FABM, including ERSEM (marine), and AED and PCLake (freshwater). FABM has also been used to model suspended sediment and redox chemistry.

 FABM has been coupled to several hydrodynamic models, including GOTM, GETM, GLM, MOM4 and MOM5. It also comes with a stand-alone box model driver.

 FABM uses modern software standards: it is coded in object-oriented Fortran 2003, has a build system based on CMake, and uses YAML files for configuration.

FABM makes it easy to partition complex biogeochemistry over many building blocks, called &quot;model instances&quot; in FABM.

It will also enable these models to continually evolve as new measurements become available, ensuring that experimental advances are rapidly converted into improved CCS modelling and, ultimately, better performance and efficiency of real CCS processes. During the project a demonstration workshop was held to train potential industrial and academic users on the use of the software.

Ultimately, the tool will make it straightforward for users to continually and rapidly update their EoS in response to emerging experimental data. The resulting EoS will deliver greater range, certainty and computational efficiency in a wide range of CCS modelling. These EoS will contribute to more effective optimisation of CCS, making the process cleaner, safer, more efficient and more economical. This modelling will also be essential to design codes and safety regulations and will provide key modelling support to the urgently required public engagement and consultation on pipeline transport of CO2.","https://www.bgs.ac.uk/ukccs/dataset.cfm?id=19851395","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56d9a16f6c83c7.49290374&grantRef=EP%2FK000446%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","DAD8D8F7-42C8-4BDC-8AFA-1F77CC7433B2","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4"

 FABM enables complex biogeochemical models to be developed as sets of stand-alone, process-specific modules. These can be combined at runtime to create custom-tailored models. This approach has been adopted to implement several large ecosystem models in FABM, including ERSEM (marine), and AED and PCLake (freshwater). FABM has also been used to model suspended sediment and redox chemistry.

 FABM has been coupled to several hydrodynamic models, including GOTM, GETM, GLM, MOM4 and MOM5. It also comes with a stand-alone box model driver.

 FABM uses modern software standards: it is coded in object-oriented Fortran 2003, has a build system based on CMake, and uses YAML files for configuration.

FABM makes it easy to partition complex biogeochemistry over many building blocks, called &quot;model instances&quot; in FABM. The fabm-ersem port currently makes everything that can be considered as &quot;integral physical particle&quot; a model instance.","Software","Yes","2015","none as yet","https://gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56cc7217bc4ca1.05505867&grantRef=pml010006","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=pml010006","D0E07F50-53BC-4A02-9DD1-53FED044E374","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","EEF9EA95-341D-48C2-8A68-B838D35497C8","7300F58C-5309-42D5-A146-F806C5FA7814"

Every single pulse in the sequence corresponds to an individual photon impinging on the photocathode of the PMT. Due to the stochastic nature of the scintillation process the output PMT signal may vary widely with regard to the occurrence time of a scintillation event, the time interval between photons and the total number of detected photons in an event. Therefore, to obtain the information on timing characteristics and the light output it is necessary to record a large number of scintillation events (10^3 - 10^4) and carry out their statistical analysis. This is achieved using fast DAQ and dedicated software that allows the measurement of decay time and light yield characteristics of scintillators in one experiment.","Detection Devices","","2013","The technique is well adapted for measurements of the variation in decay time constant in the range 10^-6-10^-3 s that can be observed in many scintillation materials during temperature changes.

However, variations in the optical path length during the finite measurement time severely limit the applicability of the method in real world environments. By the use of a second swept source measurements become immune to these variations. Our technology is based in the generation of a secondary sweep without the use of a second source, through the application of four wave mixing (a non linear effect). A prototype has been built and tested against induced variations in the optical path length, proving the ability of the technique to improve distance measurements in industrial environments with the use of our new technique based on FSI/FWM combination.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2014","The new technique provides an important impact in cost, complexity and flexibility of dual FSI based systems of range estimation.
Suppressing the need of one of the sweep sources greatly reduces the cost of the final system.
The complications associated with the required extra components for synchronization of two independent sources not only increase the cost, but also makes the process much more complicated in development, while the sweep generation through FWM works directly and without additional sync issues
FWM generation due to its nature and speed immediately adapts to any change in the source, which makes it suitable to work with different original sources without further complications.

Dedicated to Direct and Large Eddy Simulations (DNS/LES), it can combine the versatility of industrial codes with the accuracy of spectral codes. It scales with up to one million cores. 
The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized with finite-difference sixth-order schemes on a Cartesian mesh. Explicit or semi-implicit temporal schemes can be used for the time advancement depending on the flow configuration. To treat the incompressibility condition, a fractional step method requires to solve a Poisson equation. This equation is fully solved in spectral space via the use of relevant 3D Fast Fourier transforms(FFTs), allowing any kind of boundary conditions for the velocity field in each spatial direction. Using the concept of the modified wavenumber, the divergence free condition is ensured up to machine accuracy. The pressure field is staggered from the velocity field by half a mesh to avoid spurious oscillations. 
The modelling of a solid body inside the computational domain is performed with a customised Immersed Boundary Method. It is based on a direct forcing to ensure a no-slip boundary condition at the wall of the solid body while imposing non-zero velocities inside the solid body to avoid discontinuities on the velocity field. This customised IBM, fully compatible with the 2D domain decomposition and with a possible mesh refinement at the wall, is based on a 1D expansion of the velocity field from fluid regions into solid regions using Lagrange polynomials. 
To reach realistic Reynolds numbers, an implicit LES strategy can be implemented to solve the Navier-Stokes equations without any extra explicit modelling. In order to mimic a subgrid-scale model, artificial dissipation can be added via the viscous term thanks to the artificial dissipative features of the high-order compact schemes.","Software","Yes","2015","--&gt;More than 500 publications so far for work based on Incompact3d

Molecules that are calculated to fit well can therefore be made and tested experimentally, while those calculated to have a poor fit can be ignored, thus saving time and expense. However, these calculations do not always work well. These calculations usually assumes that the atomic charge distribution on the molecule and the enzyme does not change when the molecule approaches the enzyme even when the charges on some of the atoms are quite high and might therefore affect each other, i.e. one molecule might polarize the other. We have developed a method of including enzyme polarization and ligand polarization in docking that can be combined with standard state-of-the art docking software, e.g. Glide. This should greatly reduce one of the main errors in docking. The method is based on a series of Perl scripts and converts an induced dipole to a set of induced charges. The induced dipole can be calculated classically, or quantum mechanically. Typically the induced dpole at the enzyme is calculated from the ligand quantum mechanical electrostatic potential at the atoms of the enzyme.","Software","Yes","2011","Inclusion of polarization by this method typically halves the proportion of compounds incorrectly docked using GLIDE, a state-of the art docking program and therefore has the potential to facilitate the drug design process. This is particularly true when appropriate water molecules are included as part of the enzyme target.","http://ftp://ftp.essex.ac.uk/pub/oyster/polarization","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5462391323a196.22087688&grantRef=G1001812","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G1001812","03E13776-A20F-4518-8F35-8505786551F0","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","ED6A6B32-663C-4A62-A33B-2C6A68E2E102","A5BC8C8E-8FA9-4534-BFE1-1CA4E013809C"

The key objective of generating synthetic data is to replace sensitive original values with synthetic ones causing minimal distortion of the statistical information contained in the data set. Variables, which can be categorical or continuous, are synthesised one-by-one using sequential modelling. Replacements are generated by drawing from conditional distributions fitted to the original data using parametric or classification and regression trees models. Data are synthesised via the function syn() which can be largely automated, if default settings are used, or with methods defined by the user. Optional parameters can be used to influence the disclosure risk and the analytical quality of the synthesised data.","Software","Yes","2014","The synthpop package for R facilitates greatly generating non-disclosive entirely synthetic versions of sensitive restricted access microdata (e.g. the UK Longitudinal Studies) that can then be made more freely available for explanatory research and training.

The yields of crop plants are deleteriously affected by various diseases. Effective control measures
are dependent on symptom recognition and assessment of severity. Currently, these are achieved
by visual observation and estimation when crop walking which leads to inaccuracy and bias as well
as being costly and time consuming. In collaboration with our partner organisation who will
provide large-scale crop image datasets, this project aims to develop a novel diagnostic
software using image processing and machine learning approaches to both identify and measure
severity of diseases in wheat crops which will give growers more accurate information on which to
base decisions about control strategies.","Software","Yes","2015","This proposed work is extremely relevant to this call under the Digital Economy theme. Food is of
key importance in a sustainable society. Plant diseases are a major foe to global food security,
which have the potential to significantly decrease crop yields and increase postharvest losses,

sustainability of our society. This project aims to develop a software tool to effectively detect crop
diseases, reduce yield losses, improve food security and therefore achieve sustainability.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=55a535877af203.80075382&grantRef=EP%2FK003593%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/K003593/1","CDC63D48-88DC-4C4F-8C7B-BEA9E51884BD","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","14B86238-52AC-4BCD-A3B4-3B20B17270C3"

The digital technologies employed were restricted to relatively user-friendly and cost-effective software and hardware to investigate the feasibility of this process for non-experts such as museum staff. Three key techniques were used to create the shape of the model (known as its mesh): photogrammetry using digital cameras; laser measurement photogrammetry using an iPad and a Structure Sensor; and architectural drawing.

These ranged in size, shape and materials to test the digital scanning technologies.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2015","Revizto, the software used to bring together the various parts of the model (architecture, objects and additional information) and make it navigable, heard of the project through Twitter and contacted IE to write a case study and suggest ways the software could be developed to suit this type of application.

It makes use of Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation techniques and is capable of producing highly detailed construction timelines.

DfMA is a simultaneous design and engineering approach where construction components are manufactured and assembled in a controlled factory environment, prior to delivery to a construction site for installation. Precast construction is known as an enhanced method to utilize construction schedule, cost, workforce, safety and quality. DfMA techniques have a significant positive impact on safety, quality and efficiency at every stage of the project. However, prefabrication is not always a better choice than on-site construction methods. For instance, considerable cost overruns and project management issues have each been associated with prefabrication from the manufacturing up to the assembly. The decision on whether or not to prefabricate a building or parts of a building, however, is currently often based more on subjective evidence rather than a thorough analysis of consequential decisions. The available decision making tools either do not cover complete performance attributes while evaluating different construction methods or they do not consider a compromised optimal solution for the overall problem before comparing various construction techniques. 

Hence, an optimization decision support tool that integrates smaller sub-problems in Manufacturing, Transportation and Assembly (MTA) sectors is developed. Therefore, the individual sub-problems are modelled, combined and optimized according to the overall main objectives of a project. As a result, the optimal solution for different construction techniques can be compared by decision makers before suggesting a recommendation (e.g. Conventional or prefabricated) with an associated level of confidence. 

In this decision making tool, the holistic MTA system is modelled as a Resource-constrained Complex Flexible Job Shop Scheduling problem with the aim of minimizing the total completion time, cost and the number of on-site workers. A multi-objective GA-based optimization is applied to find a near optimal solution for different construction techniques. This multi-objective GA-based optimization model is developed using the C# programming language with a user-friendly GUI which provides the possibility of defining different levels of prefabrication scenarios.","Software","","2014","This has been one of the first tools of this kind - we have received positive feedback our industrial partners, who are very likely to seek adoption upon the completion of this project.

This DfMA Decision Making Tool evaluates the impact of consequential decisions from the manufacturing up to assembly in a multi-objective DfMA project. In DfMA projects, the main objectives are to minimize makespan and cost while maximizing safety, which is included in this tool. Safety is maximized by minimizing the number of on-site workers on congested construction sites. Using the multi-objective GA-based optimization model implemented in this tool, optimal solutions for different levels of prefabrication can be determined and compared with respect to overall time and cost.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=545a62d32db745.22120141&grantRef=EP%2FL504683%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/L504683/1","BD06A836-4789-454E-8A1F-7F88A0515868","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","C1493B80-DA79-46DE-81A3-F4166129BD31"

In the particular, optical geometry utilised under this project, a central, bright disc of illumination is surrounded by relatively low-intensity dark-field diffracted data. Multiple-exposure methods increase the total experimental time in a potentially unacceptable manner and, without abeam-stop, the central disc can exhibit blooming on conventional slow-readout CCDs, resulting in serious loss of data. CMOS Active Pixel Sensors (APSs) provide a high-speed imaging capability with much reduced blooming artefacts when compared to CCDs and have the potential for multiple Region of-Interest (ROI) readout. Such sensors may solve some of the fundamental problems encountered with conventional detectors used for diffractive imaging. The project supported the building of a custom detector, which may be used in both X-ray and Electron configurations, to acquire data in the diffraction plane. The X-ray detector has been successfully commissioned on the new beamline I16 and now may be used for routine experiments. The EM detector has been installed on the new R005 Electron Microscope at Sheffield and was commissioned. During the commissioning some modifications were found to required to enhance the systems flexibility, these have been made and the camera is now ready for reinstallation and continuing use.","Physical Model/Kit","","",,,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-6554278011.01866971e6e03a&grantRef=EP%2FE034055%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/E034055/1","382BDFB7-6E32-415A-9CE9-7491EB0481B8","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","1F3299AF-79D4-4812-9896-A58B7C113317"

DNA reuse in combinatorial library construction is one such idea. Here, we describe an algorithm for planning multistage assembly of DNA libraries with shared intermediates that greedily attempts to maximize DNA reuse, and show both theoretically and empirically that it runs in linear time. We compare solution quality and algorithmic performance to the best results reported for computing DNA assembly graphs, finding that our algorithm achieves solutions of equivalent quality but with dramatically shorter running times and substantially improved scalability. We also show that the related computational problem bounded-depth min-cost string production (BDMSP), which captures DNA library assembly operations with a simplified cost model, is NP-hard and APX-hard by reduction from vertex cover. The algorithm presented here provides solutions of near-minimal stages and thanks to almost instantaneous planning of DNA libraries it can be used as a metric of ?manufacturability? to guide DNA library design. Rapid planning remains applicable even for DNA library sizes vastly exceeding today's biochemical assembly methods, future-proofing our method.","Software","Yes","2014","--","http://www.dnald.org/planner/ACS_sb-2013-00161v_SI.zip","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54637280004af0.09787477&grantRef=EP%2FI031642%2F2","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I031642/2","AB4C95B0-0BCC-4B8A-924C-90858D2E34B8","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68","21C6DDE0-BAD0-4BE9-BC4D-6C9C3E5BC98C"

Datapoint errors in pedigree genotype datasets are difficult to identify and adversely affect downstream genetic analyses. Errors that are inconsistent with the rules of Mendelian inheritance typically invalidate linkage analysis algorithms, and cause such analyses to fail. Genotype errors may arise from a variety of systematic or sporadic errors in either the genotyping assay, or in recording the pedigree or genotype information.

By applying an inheritance-checking algorithm for markers across the pedigree and visualising the inheritance data in an exploratory user interface, VIPER allows the sources of data inconsistency can be resolved.

VIPER displays the structure of the study population in a novel pedigree visualisation of generation sandwiches. Error rates reported by the inheritance algorithm are overlaid on the pedigree structure, allowing the inheritance pattern of reported errors to be explored, and the likely underlying bad datapoint resolved.","Webtool/Application","","2012","Permits more rapid and efficient cleaning and repair of genotype data from pedigree populations.

An ideal application of these sensors is the real-time, hand held analysis of the microbiological quality of drinking water, particularly in areas of poor or no sanitation as widely found in developing countries and during disaster relief scenarios.","Physical Model/Kit","","2015","The prototype is being used for the first time to establish bacterial numbers in a wide range of water samples (including river water and effluent from sewage treatment works). Preliminary testing, research and prototype development demonstrate the potential of using a portable fluorimeter as an initial screening tool for indicative microbial water quality in disaster relief, and one that is ideally suited to simple pollution scenarios such as assessing the impact of faecal contamination in river or groundwater at specific sites. Furthermore, there is the ability to have both expert interpretation of results as well as simplified pictorial interpretation for use by non-experts in individual communities. Thus, the innovative approach to improving the efficiency of analysis has the additional benefit of community empowerment through involving poor water users themselves in the application of the technology.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56e059e47cb2b0.02584456&grantRef=EP%2FI001379%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I001379/1","FEBC0E06-1ED4-42DE-9E4C-AE45AEFD0E66","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","A0F31F31-5F29-4F43-9497-31DF01F580E9"

However, current devices are very poor at conveying pitch information and therefore, although many CI express a desire to hear music again, many are dissatisfied with the way music sounds through their implant.

The IMAP has 24 sessions that link to stand alone applications, which enable users to create and manipulate music. The applications are introduced using written and subtitled video instructions, and each session ends with either a test or directed listening task.

The accurate prediction of absolute protein-ligand binding free energies is one of the grand challenge problems of computational science. Binding free energy measures the strength of binding between a ligand and a protein, and an algorithm that would allow its accurate prediction would be a powerful tool for rational drug design. Here we present the development of a new method that allows for the absolute binding free energy of a protein-ligand complex to be calculated from first principles, using a single simulation. Our method involves the use of a novel reaction coordinate that swaps a ligand bound to a protein with an equivalent volume of bulk water. This water-swap reaction coordinate is built using an identity constraint, which identifies a cluster of water molecules from bulk water that occupies the same volume as the ligand in the protein active site. A dual topology algorithm is then used to swap the ligand from the active site with the identified water cluster from bulk water. The free energy is then calculated using replica exchange thermodynamic integration. This returns the free energy change of simultaneously transferring the ligand to bulk water, as an equivalent volume of bulk water is transferred back to the protein active site. This, directly, is the absolute binding free energy. It should be noted that while this reaction coordinate models the binding process directly, an accurate force field and sufficient sampling are still required to allow for the binding free energy to be predicted correctly. In this paper we present the details and development of this method, and demonstrate how the potential of mean force along the water-swap coordinate can be improved by calibrating the soft-core Coulomb and Lennard-Jones parameters used for the dual topology calculation. The optimal parameters were applied to calculations of protein-ligand binding free energies of a neuraminidase inhibitor (oseltamivir), with these results compared to experiment.

Many are also prime drug targets, and it has been estimated that more than half of all drugs currently on the market target membrane proteins. However, due to the experimental difficulties involved in obtaining high quality crystals, this class of protein is severely under-represented in structural databases. In the absence of structural data, sequence-based prediction methods allow TM protein topology to be investigated.
Results

MEMSAT is a TM protein topology predictor that integrates both signal peptide and re-entrant helix prediction, benchmarked with full cross-validation on a novel data set of 131 sequences with known crystal structures. The method achieves topology prediction accuracy of 89%, while signal peptides and re-entrant helices are predicted with 93% and 44% accuracy respectively. An additional SVM trained to discriminate between globular and TM proteins detected zero false positives, with a low false negative rate of 0.4%. We present the results of applying these tools to a number of complete genomes.","Software","Yes","2009","Has been licensed to 3 companies so far.","http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/web_servers","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=545f71e5c85689.88703299&grantRef=BB%2FE022278%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/E022278/1","B0DF8BDD-0E9D-4FC1-A19A-F070E0F7BF97","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","648AF67D-A9EA-48C9-BB7C-EF285375A5F6"

The method utilities the simultaneous acquisition of hundreds of nanoparticles for statistical analysis. The method is simple, rapid, and quantitative. We have demonstrated a sensitivity of s_ext =5nm2 corresponding to the detection of a single gold nanoparticle of 5nm diameter, using only ~1min total acquisition time. From the measurement of s_ext and its dependence on the light polarization, an accurate quantification of particle sizes and asymmetries at the single particle level is rapidly obtained for a statistically-relevant number (&gt;100) of particles. An Extinction Suite Macro for ImageJ was also developed, for quantitative data analysis.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2013","This technique has generated commercial interested with our industrial collaborators BBI Solution, a world leading nanoparticle manufacturer. Precise characterisation of nanoparticle sizes and shapes is key to manufacturing quality control. Current techniques for particle characterisation are dynamics light scattering (DLS), which is easy to use but not very accurate and provides only the effective mean size (hydrodynamic radius), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which is time consuming and expensive. The optical extinction microscopy method developed by us overcomes these limitations and effectively complements these analysis techniques. BBI is interested in a knowledge transfer partnership on this technology.","http://langsrv.astro.cf.ac.uk/Crosssection/Extinction_Suite/Extinction_Suite.html","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56c76341888e50.34872468&grantRef=EP%2FI005072%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I005072/1","616D23C0-355A-434E-B4E3-8FB41D360517","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","9C10D78F-6430-4CA7-9528-B96B0762A4C6","016FF124-4728-46AD-B334-F8255F9CDDBA"

It is installed on over 70,000 computers world-wide, on hundreds of thousands of web pages, and in daily use by thousands of scientists and students. Although other programs exist to visualise and edit multiple alignments, Jalview not only allows alignments to be viewed coloured and edited, but also exploits the internet to connect to over 1000 sources of sequences and complex annotations on those sequences. In addition, Jalview exploits state-of-the-art internet technology to connect to computer servers that can perform large calculations on the sequences and return these to the user in a few seconds or minutes.

This is achieved through a regularised Gauss-Newton iterative scheme. The code is intended as a proof-of-concept and so is limited to the recovery of a spherical inclusion.

The forward solver driving the iterative scheme solves the eddy current approximation of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. This makes use of H(curl)-conforming hp-finite element methods at arbitrary polynomial order, which have been implemented in the deal.II finite element library. A fully benchmarked version of this code can be found at https://github.com/rosskynch/MIT_Forward. Note that there may be some minor alterations between the two forward solvers in these two repositories, but they are largely the same.

The deal.II library, found at http://www.dealii.org is required for this code to run.

Assuming deal.II 8.3 is installed and configured properly, then the code should run successfully. However, we recommend that the deal.II development branch dated July 6th (SHA hash 79583e56) is used to ensure total compatibility.

Auto-segmentation - where bitmap based images (bit-for-bit, raster graphics, pixels, points, image, jpeg) such as photos, screengrabs, iPad art can be converted to vectors. The algorithm automatically separates the image into coloured layers. The layers are determined by: edge strength, texture direction, x/y pixel adjacency, hue/saturation/ brightness. This approach is inspired by the Non-photorealistic rendering algorithms for texture directionality described by Kasao et al through several papers (Kasao, 2006; Kasao 1998a; Kasao1998b). 

Autographic - where vector based graphics (paths, points, handles, anchors, B&eacute;zier curves, smooth lines) such as AutoCad Illustrator, Freehand, can be exported as vector based images (line work, x-y-z, postscript, svg, animation). Layers, brush dimensions and lengths, characterisation of brush strokes can be maintained and used to drive the painting machine. This approach is inspired by Direct Write printing processes (Clem and Bell, 2013; Lewis, 2006).","Software","Yes","2015","The auto-segmentation approach, allows the program to convert the pixels in a picture/photograph into vector paths that can be used to drive a paintbrush or pen on the printing machine. Although the program performs most of the segmenting, the user can manually adjust many different settings to achieve the desired printed output. 
Texture Smoothing - as the following figure illustrates, reduces the complexity of vector direction in the image, resulting in a decrease in texture noise. 
Min Width - describes the minimum width of the stroke, which emulates the size of the paintbrush that will be used in the painting machine. For example, if a high degree of fine detail is required, the number is set to low and a fine brush is used. If a thicker brush is required, set this high (measurements in mm). 
 Max Width (Layer) - describes the maximum possible width of the stroke, encapsulating the spread of bristles, permitting variation in width across the length of a single stroke. This specifies the width per layer, and will automatically set itself to the maximum width available when brush strokes are generated by the software.
 Max Width (global) - Allows the user to set the maximum desirable width of stroke for all layers. Each layer may not attain the maximum width, which can be inspected via Max Width (layer). 
 Max Length (Layer) - describes the maximum length of the brush stroke per layer. This can also be changed for each layer of the print, but will be automatically updated to represent the longest stroke in the layer after stroke generation. Longer brush strokes suit a certain style of print, for a pointillist style then select a short stroke length (measurements in mm).
 Max Length (global) - Allows the user to set the maximum desirable length of stroke for all layers. Each layer may not attain the maximum length, which can be inspected via Max Length (layer).
Bleed - The program default setting will prevent each layer of colour from overlapping. However, by adjusting the bleed of the layers, the density of the stroke can be modified by increasing the bleed, and thus forcing the layers and colours to overlap. This changes the appearance of the image to create a more gestural effect that might be more appropriate for a watercolour painting, as opposed to a more hard edge graphic effect by maintaining edge definition","http://www.uwe.ac.uk/sca/research/cfpr/research/twoandahalfD/auto%20segmentation%20how_to.html","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56cc8e0dacbc73.66899258&grantRef=AH%2FL015277%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=AH/L015277/1","FE8816B5-BBAD-49D1-80FA-BBE9FCBF9DC9","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","2A80FFDA-3B8B-43BA-80C3-3AA850B49BA1","733F67BB-F941-4867-8E92-62A780177538"

These painting machines have undergone various iterations and refinements. We began by hacking a vinyl-cutting plotter and replaced the cutting head for a paintbrush holder. 

A second machine, a low cost wood router kit with 3 degrees of freedom (x, y and z) was modified to carry a paintbrush and other deposition tools. The machine has a printable area of 310mm by 260mm and a range of 40mm vertically. The machine is built from an extruded aluminium frame and NEMA17 stepper motors drive the x-y and the z axis. 

The third generation machine has a printable area of approximately 1.3 x 1.3 metres, again constructed to our specification. It comfortably takes an A0 sheet of paper and enables us to make much larger gestural paintings.","Physical Model/Kit","","2016","Variations include methods to load the brush with paint, such as a paint pot-holder that could rotate underneath the brush and rotate away to enable excess paint to be removed as the brush is drawn up. 

The software communicates using the GCode standard protocol for CNC machine operation. To replicate our printing machine, you need to adapt a CNC wood router to hold a paintbrush. Our paintbrush holder was 3D printed, and the model files are also available online to 3D print.","http://www.uwe.ac.uk/sca/research/cfpr/research/twoandahalfD/auto%20segmentation%20how_to.html","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56cc8f3b88f906.01342911&grantRef=AH%2FL015277%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=AH/L015277/1","FE8816B5-BBAD-49D1-80FA-BBE9FCBF9DC9","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","2A80FFDA-3B8B-43BA-80C3-3AA850B49BA1","733F67BB-F941-4867-8E92-62A780177538"

The aim of Rapid is to make completing these tasks as simple as purchasing a book or booking a ?ight on the web.

The philosophy of Rapid is to deliver customised graphical user interfaces that enable domain specialists to achieve their tasks. These tasks make use of domain-speci?c applications that run on remote compute resources; a requirement which is satis?ed by translating the task into one or several computational jobs to be performed on Grid and Cloud Computing infrastructures, and High-Performance Computing facilities.

Customised interfaces allow tasks to be performed without referring to terminology about the underlying computational infrastructure. Moreover, the system allows to expose particular features of applications as not to overwhelm the user.","Grid Application","","2010","Further development of Rapid and the application of Rapid to seismology, earthquake prediction, brain imaging, microscopy and computational chemistry was funded by EPSRC, BBSRC, NERC, JISC, ENGAGE (JISC) and OMII-UK (EPSRC).

Most health and veterinary facilities had no internet access and unreliable power, but mobile phone reception was widely available and local workers all already owned mobile phones. The system was developed to use the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network infrastructure, which is widely available from mobile phone network providers in Tanzania, with coverage strength and quality largely determined by proximity to a network tower. The system comprises a centralized server with a MySQL database for data storage and management, and client-side java enabled mobile phone handsets running open source software (openXdata).","Webtool/Application","","2011","Improved surveillance of rabies in Tanzania and improved healthcare for people bitten by suspect dogs which has resulted in lives saved.

It is designed to work on OS X, Windows (currently no digital I/O) or Linux, and interfaces via strobed words (using either a DataPixx [15bit] or a LabJack [11bit]) and ethernet with a Plexon Omniplex for recording neurophysiological data. Behavioural control uses the Eyelink eye tracker and a full behavioural repertoire is available by using a state-machine logic. Opticka uses the ethernet interface to the Eyelink thus affording much better control and reliability over using the analog voltages alone. The various classes can be used without the need to run the GUI and stimuli provide a unified interface (setup, animate, draw, update, reset) to integrate into standard PTB routines. The various object methods take care of all the background geometry and normalization, meaning stimuli are much easier to use than &quot;raw&quot; PTB. Analysis routines are also present for taking the raw Plexon files (.PLX or .PL2) and Eyelink files (.EDF) and parsing them into a consistent trials and variable structure, for analysis in matlab, or interfacing directly with Fieldtrip for further spike and LFP analysis.","Software","Yes","2012","This visual display and experimental control software has underpinned our ability to generate the necessary visual stimuli and control paradigms to gather the experimental data in our acute and behaving primate work.

It has been extended to compile the Swan language extensions. Swan is an extension of the MIT Cilk/Intel Cilkplus language and adds dataflow annotations to tasks. The software recognises now special variables that signify dataflow dependences between tasks and generates code for checking and enforcing dependences at runtime. The generated code interfaces with the Intel Cilkplus runtime, which has been also modified to schedule the task dataflow programs.

The film is fabricated as follows: 
15 mg of methanofullerene phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is dissolved in 3 ml dimethylformamide (DMF) and ultra-sonicated for 1 hour. 15 mg double wall carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) are added to the PCBM solution and ultrasonicated for 30 minutes. A solution of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (300 mg in 3 ml DMF) is added as binder to the CNT-PCBM solution and stirred. Finally the PVDF-CNT-PCBM suspension is ball milled (planetary) in grinding jar (25 ml) with single metal ball for 2 hours with an interval of 30 s after every 2 minutes. The ball-milled PCP suspension is casted over clean soda-lime glass slide.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2015","As this flexible conducting film was of great importance for this project because it allows to transfer-print CNT structures, and to fabricate good excellent battery electrodes.

We present SurreyFBA, which provides constraint-based simulations and network map visualization in a free, stand-alone software. In addition to basic simulation protocols, the tool also implements the analysis of minimal substrate and product sets, which is useful for metabolic engineering and prediction of nutritional requirements in complex in vivo environments, but not available in other commonly used programs. The SurreyFBA is based on a command line interface to the GLPK solver distributed as binary and source
code for the three major operating systems. The command line tool, implemented in C++, is easily executed within scripting languages used in the bioinformatics community and provides efficient implementation of tasks requiring iterative calls to the linear programming solver. SurreyFBA includes JyMet, a graphics user interface allowing spreadsheet-based model presentation, visualization of numerical results on metabolic networks represented in the Petri net convention, as well as in charts and plots.","Software","Yes","2011","The SurreyFBA has been used to provide biological insight in bacterial pathogen and biotechnology research at Surrey.

Due to Data Protection concerns, the current agreements in place for the LSs mean that it is not possible to access LS data outwith its respective safe-setting. This means that to-date it has not been possible to fully combine datasets to allow comparisons between regions or to create a UK-wide sample. Instead the only option has been to conduct separate analyses and then compare or combine the results on an ad-hoc basis.

Work in the SLS-DSU has resulted in a new methodology which means it is now possible to analyse data from one or more LS as though they were part of the same dataset.

Silica dissolution is assumed to be dependent on temperature and on the ratio between silica and carbon in the particles. Si:C ratio represents the magnitude of the organic coat which reduces the dissolution of silica (i.e. low Si:C ratios decrease the dissolution rate). In this way, the model accounts for the role played by pelagic bacteria in this process. Bacteria, in fact, are able to increase the Si:C ratio in particulate organic matter by only using C and leaving Si.","Software","","2015","This new development improves the representation of Si dynamics in ERSEM",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56cee727c24b50.43510723&grantRef=pml010010","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=pml010010","462741ED-E730-4D74-A35B-69D4A9051ACF","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","EEF9EA95-341D-48C2-8A68-B838D35497C8","DC169932-DEA2-4658-A6C7-73FD7A834F99"

Each model incorporated a scale model of an urban area with a river and typical urban infrastructure, i.e. houses, shops, industrial units, roads and parks. The models also included a sprinkler system to simulate rainfall, with water being fed to the sprinklers and river via a system of pumps. Workshop participants are able to change certain elements of the urban fabric in an attempt to reduce the severity of flooding, e.g. replace tarmac with permeable paving, swap conventional roof surfaces for green roof surfaces, etc.","Physical Model/Kit","","2011","This model has been been the inspiration for similar interactive workshops focused on flooding.","http://urbanfloodmodel.wordpress.com/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-904693725.43012146fd2622c&grantRef=EP%2FG062625%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/G062625/1","CF3C465C-8A0E-4162-B3E7-58B61E8713D3","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","E5A82D2C-5AD4-488A-ACFF-566345A5D6DA","2F7B019E-2E4D-480E-A038-487FCB051E05"

The development of this app was a collaborative co-production project between De Montfort University's Digital Building Heritage Group and the Department of Archaeology at the University of Durham (Co-Investigator Dr David Petts) and the Architectural and Archaeological Society of Durham and Northumberland (Arc &amp; Arc). The objective was to create a new, prototype mobile device app which allow finds and other information to be uploaded by users to 3D representations of archaeological and historical sites and then be explored in an intuitive way. The idea behind this was to give community heritage groups' greater opportunities to interpret their own finds and present them in a way which would allow these groups to shape the stories about the archaeology they were involved with. There are two key new concepts in this prototype app which makes it different from other data-base archaeology apps that are available and which make a significant advance in the functionality and use-ability of apps on archaeological sites for heritage interpretation. The first is the ability for registered users to upload finds data to an on-line Content Management System (CMS). This is done over the internet using a normal web-browser. Information about finds and the archaeology to upload can be text, images, video and audio. These finds data can be geo-located in three dimensions using a graphic x,y,z slider bar system in the app to very precise points in 3D on the archaeological site by the user during the upload. By pressing an update button on the app screen, the new finds data will be uploaded from the server and become clickable hot-spots in the app on the iPAD which will show the finds data in a new screen and also signal that there is new data for existing hot-spots. The hot spots move with the 3D model of the building as you rotate it around. There is also a Google Map view which allows you see the hot-spots in 2D in map form which is good for very large sites. The second innovation in these apps is the use of 3D reconstructions of the buildings associated with the finds and the way they are presented. The hot-spots appear in three dimensions in the buildings. In order to reveal ones inside structures or in walls and floors or underground there is a clever section slider which allows the user to see inside the buildings and their walls and floors. In this way it really is like digging down and through the building to reveal the locations of finds so that you can click on them. The app is free to download from Apple's App Store and at present is available for Apple's iPad only. Search for &quot;Binchester&quot; in the App Store.","Webtool/Application","","2015","The results from development process and testing of this app have shown that public interest in using apps for archaeology is increasingly rapidly in the UK and both professional and community archaeologists find it useful to present their work to public audiences, often on site, to show how exciting finds can inform the understanding of the communities and landscapes where we live. Presenting individual artefacts using the app can help bring the past back to life and the complex topography and architecture of the archaeological site of Binchester Roman Fort, can be better explained by the interactive visualisation of the app, increasing the speed of cognitive understanding of fragmentary and now hidden parts of buildings and the site's overall schema. While this apsect of the app and out put from this project was highly successful, there was only moderate success in affording the opportunity for community archaeologists in uploading artefact data to the app's Content Management System (CMS) because it was found that while this aspect of the app functioned well technically, there was a perception that the process was too slow and technically demanding for those with little or no prior experience. We accept this view and are seeking to develop an improved and more user friendly paradigm for this aspect of the concept.","https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roman-binchester/id1005641817?mt=8","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56d4471cec8a38.75073178&grantRef=AH%2FL013290%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=AH/L013290/1","EB3F693D-F6B3-42A6-85BB-698035E46444","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","DF259B19-FD17-4588-BFEF-AD08F1193451","2503091D-A6F6-479F-9B28-2EDB216D43D0"

It should be noted that this automated radius estimation technique is a small side deviation from my main project work. It is currently only effective on the type of data clusters in the demonstration files, i.e. normally distributed data in elliptical clusters. Further work is required on the method of detecting the density drops and a more effective cluster joining method to provide further to create a more robust technique. It should be regarded as a demonstration of the possibilities rather than a completed technique. For further details please see the paper A Fully Autonomous Data Density Based Clustering Technique

The women who attended the face-to-face training offered by the UWE team do not have to repeat the on-line training but we recommend alta members return to the on-line training from time to time to refresh their knowledge and skills.","http://alta-mentoring.com","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56c865eb047a81.58865335&grantRef=ES%2FM004775%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=ES/M004775/1","374D2630-3345-4713-A470-91839DE48C8C","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","2A80FFDA-3B8B-43BA-80C3-3AA850B49BA1","1A5A88B1-0D94-495B-BF4F-25B1819F55B3"

The self tracking antenna available at the beginning of the follow on fund could only track unmodulated CW signals in the laboratory and could not track signals from an actual satellite. During the year of the follow on fund a new method was produced (IP currently being protected) to allow an analogue phase locked loop to track very low level signals which are phase modulated with either QPSK or 16QAM.

The main aim of SMALLbox is to become a test ground for exploration of new provably good methods to obtain inherently data-driven sparse models, which are able to cope with large-scale and complicated data. The main focus of research in the area of sparse representations is in deveoping reliable algorithms with provable performance and bounded complexity. Yet, such approaches are simply inapplicable in many scenarios for which no suitable sparse model is known. Moreover, the success of sparse models heavily depends on the choice of a &quot;dictionary&quot; to reflect the natural structures of a class of data. Inferring a dictionary from training data is a key to the extension of sparse models for new exotic types of data.

This new approach permits 3-D imaging via ultrathin (~100?s microns) fibre-optic bundles with no need for distal optics or moving parts since both scanning and focussing can be implemented by manipulating the phase profile of the excitation light emerging from the optical fibre cores at the distal end of the fibre optic bundle.

This instrument can enable spectrally resolved lifetime measurements via a specially designed fibre-optic probe that is 2.4 mm diameter such that it can pass through the (2.8 mm) biopsy channel of a standard clinical endoscope. It has been engineered to be self-contained on a trolley and is implemented with gain-switched picosecond diode lasers for excitation in the u.v. and blue. FLIM is implemented with time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and spectral discrimination is provided by either a spectrometer or dichroic beam splitters and filters. We have also incorporated a spectrometer to record the diffuse reflectivity spectrum for white light illumination.

This multimodal single-point fibre-optic probe thus provides real-time measurements of tissue properties and, because it bins all the photons detected from a ~mm area of tissue into only a few detection channels, provides high signal to noise ratio with sufficient numbers of detected photons to permit (spectrally-resovled) analysis of complex fluorescence decay profiles, such as are typically encountered with tissue autofluorescence.

Sites can focus on specific taxonomic groups, or the biodiversity of a biogeographic region, or indeed any aspect of natural history. Scratchpads are also suitable for societies or for managing and presenting projects. Key features of Scratchpads (see also Scratchpads feature list) include: tools to manage biological classifications, bibliography management, media (images, video and audio), rich taxon pages (with structured descriptions, specimen records, and distribution data), and character matrices.

It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations involved.

Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard format for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.
SEEK is incorporating semantic technology allowing sophisticated queries over the data, yet without getting in the way of your users.","Software","Yes","2009","The SEEK4Science platform was adopted by the all of the ERANet SysMO I and II projects it was designed for and has gone on to be widely adopted in other programmes, notably the German Virtual Liver Network and its followon Liver Systems Medicine project, ERANet's ERASysBio+ projects, and ERASysAPP. 
The Platform is now developed under the FAIRDOM Initiative (funded by the DMMCore project partners, including the BBSRC) http://www.fair-dom.org.

The platform has been adopted by 21 independent projects and groups (e.g. Unicellsys, JenAge, RosAge, SBCancer, Sybacol, SBEpo, SARCHI, VU Amsterdam for Yeast Glycolysis, Systems Science for Health in Birmingham, Magdeburg Centre for Systems Biology). EU Projects that adopt the platform include: EmPowerPutida and Mycosynvac

Combined with the openBIS system (as a result of the DMMCore project) it is the platform for two UK Synthetic Biology Centre's data management (SynBioChem and SynthSys). 

The platform has been adopted by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory a large national scientific user facility (800 scientists, 1500 instruments) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, USA
It has been adopted by the German de.NBI German Bioinformatics Network and the GenoSysFat and DigiSal Norwegian National Projects. 

34 projects are currently registered on FAIRDOMHub Commons, a centralised public community instance of the SEEK4Science Platform. 
Work on the SysMO-DB project and the SEEK directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe, and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area. The SEEK4Science software and associated software, FAIRDOMHub Commons and its support services form a core pillar of the ISBE Light Interim phase. 

Commercially, SEEK was the prototype component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's ElasticAP platform.

Wruck et al. Data management strategies for multinational large-scale systems biology projects. Briefings in Bioinformatics 2012 stated that Out of the box it provides the most useful features for large scale biology projects.

Practical evaluation of SEEK and OpenBIS for biological data management in SynthSys; first report (https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/12236) recommended the platform.

The SysMO-DB project also directly lead to the FAIRDOM project, a consortium of 4 EU funding councils to: Establish a sustainable European Infrastructure to extend the network services to the wider European systems biology community; Develop the necessary toolset and set up a data and model management platform for systems biology project, building on SEEK and openBIS (SystemsX); and document and disseminate the outcomes and activities to funding agencies, projects and centres with the goal of establishing a sustainable business model for this infrastructure.

The SRF encompasses this software and other associated repository systems for LIMS and environmental (eg sensor) data and can also be coupled with pervasive and non invasive approaches to capturing this data. The SRF enables scientists to follow a method much closer to the original concept of experimental science in terms of declaring a hypothesis, recording data and analysing results. Furthermore, scientists will no longer have to print out data results to insert into conventional lab books; instead, results will be logically associated with the experiment and therefore accessible as required. Thus it is possible to pivot the material and view the data in a chronological diary form for example ordata-centrically in terms of the scientific argument.","Software","","2011","A few hundred users, most are using LabTrove as software as a Service on hosted system, hosted by Southampton or the Royal Society of Chemistry and a couple of other places (such and University of Sydney and UNSW and now starting up at NTU).

Different correction methods are applied today based on auxiliary data, including GNSS, weather models (e.g. ECMWF ERA-I, WRF, NARR, etc), spectrometer data (MERIS and MODIS), or combinations of different sources. Alternative methods exist to estimate the tropospheric delays from the radar data themselves. The success rate of the different techniques is dependant on multiple factors like temporal and spatial resolution, cloud cover, signal contamination, local topography, etc.

TRAIN provides a set of MATLAB tools that can be used to correct for tropospheric delays in InSAR data. Once set-up for one correction method, the toolbox allows for easy comparison with other methods, as all are formatted in the same way. The toolbox is fully compatible, but not limited, to the Doris and StaMPS software. Initial debugging has been done for ROI_PAC and PI-rate processed data, but user feedback and reporting will allow for further development. The toolbox includes the correction methods provided below, with a full descriptive manual on the input parameters, and tips/hints in case of problems.","Software","Yes","2015","The software has been downloaded 327 times by groups all over the world.","http://davidbekaert.com/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56e042303f6080.09681394&grantRef=come30001","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=come30001","70E11BCA-D6E5-4D10-B3E4-41D575EC82C0","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","7ADE0AB2-1050-4241-987D-F3B1C3322E05","5C230A92-D6F8-45E7-8735-1553D8A3741B"

The Infobiotics Workbench is comprised of the following components:

 a modelling language based on P systems which allows modular and parsimonious multi-cellular model development where the outermost compartments can be positioned in 2-dimensional space to facilitate modelling at either extra-, inter- or intracellular levels of detail

 deterministic and stochastic simulator using algorithms optimised for large multi-compartmental systems (the simulator also accept a subset of SBML, allowing for visual model specification using tools such as CellDesigner)

 formal model analysis for the study of temporal and spatial model properties supported the model checkers PRISM and MC2

 model structure and parameter optimisation using a variety of evolutionary and population-based algorithms to automatically generate models whose dynamics match specified target timeseries

DNA reuse in combinatorial library construction is one such idea. Here, we describe an algorithm for planning multistage assembly of DNA libraries with shared intermediates that greedily attempts to maximize DNA reuse, and show both theoretically and empirically that it runs in linear time. We compare solution quality and algorithmic performance to the best results reported for computing DNA assembly graphs, finding that our algorithm achieves solutions of equivalent quality but with dramatically shorter running times and substantially improved scalability. We also show that the related computational problem bounded-depth min-cost string production (BDMSP), which captures DNA library assembly operations with a simplified cost model, is NP-hard and APX-hard by reduction from vertex cover. The algorithm presented here provides solutions of near-minimal stages and thanks to almost instantaneous planning of DNA libraries it can be used as a metric of ?manufacturability? to guide DNA library design. Rapid planning remains applicable even for DNA library sizes vastly exceeding today's biochemical assembly methods, future-proofing our method.","Software","Yes","2014","--","http://www.dnald.org/planner/ACS_sb-2013-00161v_SI.zip","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54637280004af0.09787477&grantRef=EP%2FI031642%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I031642/1","874E9A5B-0D7C-49CB-A093-4E1B8F24D127","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","936D002F-A8D1-4A93-AE5D-825ED0903D8D","21C6DDE0-BAD0-4BE9-BC4D-6C9C3E5BC98C"

With the growing popularity of social networks and video services, users are becoming the editors and broadcasters of their own stories. User-generated video content, which provides unique perspectives from individuals, is likely to be the new medium to complement professional broadcast TV for story sharing, especially in user communities of specific interest. We have developed Storisphere to provide a web-based collaborative video content workspace for members of a community to compose and share video stories, using desktop or mobile devices.

Allport et al. &quot;Radiation tests of ATLAS full-sized n-in-n prototype detectors.&quot; Nucl.Instrum. Meth. A418 (1998) 110-119). Through the PhD thesis project of a CASE student (Moshe Hanlon, 1999) with Micron Semiconductor (UK) Ltd, we explored the possibility of producing such sensors with single-sided processing by starting with a p-type substrate (up to this point the detectors provided to nuclear physics, particle physics, space science, astrophysics and medical physics had all been based on very high resistivity n-type silicon substrates). This work has continued to 2012 with the Liverpool Semiconductor Detector Centre (funded by STFC). We continue to play a leading role in the development of this technology with refinement of p-type structure and understanding of the fundamental device physics leading to the recognition of the reasons for the device radiation hardness (30 publications). As part of our recognition for developing this technology, one of our team members (Dr Gianluigi Casse) currently leads the RD50 collaboration (Radiation Hard Sensors for the LHC) at CERN of over 300 scientists, while another, Professor Phil Allport, is Upgrade Coordinator of the 3000 strong ATLAS Experiment. 
This research has led the two main LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS to adopt n+p (the world?s largest scientific experiments) as their baseline technology for the LHC Upgrades. The Liverpool group also built the first full size LHC prototype sensors for ATLAS Upgrade and in 2012 completed the build of an entire n+p Vertex Detector for LHCb (the first complete detector system of its kind in the world).
Our contribution to developing and modelling the intrinsic devices have made them cheap, stable and a reliable commercial technology. The number of international companies and research facilities now able to offer p-type sensors for high radiation environments has grown to 8 including the world's largest supplier Hamamatsu Photonics (Japan) and now 2 UK companies (Micron and e2v Technologies Ltd). From 2008 onwards this research was conducted as part of the STFC Rolling Grant.

However, due to local constraints on site, it was not possible to conduct this experiment with our partners at the Akrotiri excavation. We still plan to run the fully-fledged study as soon as the situation on site has changed (hopefully in summer 2015), which will aim at including the regular visitors to the Akrotiri excavation as test subjects, too.

It is based on the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmospheric Model (CAM), but replacing the conventional convective parameterization with a cloud-resolving model. Our work has been to couple SPCAM to the multi-column KPP model, which was developed at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science.

With the data-generative approaches that are increasingly common in modern life science research, it is vital that the data and metadata produced by these efforts can be shared and reused. The Grassroots Infrastructure project wraps up industry-standard software tools with a consistent API that can be federated on a number of levels. This means institutions and groups can deploy a simple lightweight virtual machine, expose local data, connect up any existing data services, and federate their instance of the Grassroots with others out-of-the-box.","Software","Yes","2015","The Grassroots API powers the public BLAST service that runs at TGAC, predominantly for the currently available wheat assemblies including the recently released TGAC v1 w2rap assembly (in preparation). We have served over 4000 unique users with over 6000 BLAST jobs since November 2015.

It also underpins the Field Pathgenomics project (BBSRC IPA award 2015, PI - Saunders D., TGAC/JIC fellow), a web portal that represents the detection and subsequent phenotyping and genotyping of the wheat yellow rust pathogen. The site aims to enable researchers and breeders to track rust epidemics over variety and time, allowing for a more proactive approach to wheat crop breeding and farming.

Finally, we are working with the CerealsDB group at Univ. Bristol to deploy the Grassroots infrastructure alongside the CerealsDB web portal, allowing a federation of searching, datasets, analysis and dissemination of markers, genotypes and associated feature and literature information.","https://wheatis.tgac.ac.uk/grassroots/api/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56d47f945efe06.16699343&grantRef=BB%2FL024144%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/L024144/1","06DE6CAC-AA95-4CCE-A0DA-54CED1590886","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","B7B056A3-95CE-4F90-9F31-708B4612610D","59FE795E-4137-4E0D-B2E1-83D5681F28C8"

Developing the science to describe and predict how people move from one place to another during their daily lives promises to address a wide range of societal challenges: from predicting the spread of infectious diseases, improving urban planning, to devising effective emergency response strategies. Individuals are also set to benefit from this area of research, as mobile devices will be able to analyse their mobility pattern and offer context-aware assistance and information. For example, a service could warn about travel disruptions before the user is likely to encounter them, or provide recommendations and mobile vouchers for local services that promise to be of high value to the user, based on their predicted future plans. More ambitiously, control systems for home heating and electric vehicle charging could be enhanced with knowledge of when the user will be home.","Software","","2013","?

In other words, it produces an (estimated) itemised energy bill from just a single, whole-house power meter.

NILM is sometimes called:
•&quot;non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NALM or NIALM)&quot;
•&quot;[electriciy | energy | smart meter] disaggregation&quot;

NILMTK is a toolkit designed to help researchers evaluate the accuracy of NILM algorithms. NILMTK is not yet suitable for end users because NILMTK is not yet capable of out-of-the-box disaggregation (i.e. disaggregation where you do not yet have submetered training data), although we hope that it might be some time in the future.","Software","Yes","2014","NILMTK v0.2 includes a combinatorial optimisation NILM algorithm.

SatNav for historical maps: A phone app that combines GPS technology with old maps to allow users to walk through time. The Map set is for central Edinburgh although now features maps for Dundee, Glasgow and Perth. The app allows the user to see a variety of Historic maps from 1765 to 1939 and reveal the many changes of the cities over time. The application also comes with a set of narrated walking tours from the Edinburgh College of Art and Edinburgh World Heritage.

Walking Through Time is a mobile application that allows iPhone users with GPS to not only find themselves in the present, but find themselves in the past. By making available historical UK maps, users will be able to scroll through time and navigate places using maps that are hundreds of years old.

The maps are provided by National Library of Scotland, the Visualising Urban Geographies research group, and EDINA, overlayed with modern day maps.","Webtool/Application","","2012","Walking Through Time became a quick hit that demonstrated the potential for mashing up different maps and geographic data on the Apple iPhone.

In practice, this means that developers can take existing software tools or libraries and wrap them as software components using the features provided by the libhpc-cf library. These components can then be linked to form more advanced processes by applying coordination forms to them. Coordination forms allow the specification of richer orchestration than traditional workflow languages and the library is extensible to allow the addition of further coordination forms. Coordination forms can vary from basic structures, such as specifying that a set of dependent components are processed sequentially or that a set of independent components may be processed in parallel, to advanced domain specific languages. A further key benefit of both components and coordination forms specified within the libhpc-cf library is that both can have multiple implementations allowing different approaches to be used to undertake a given task depending on the type of target computing platform to be used or the problem being addressed.","Software","Yes","2015","The libhpc-cf library provides a modern Python implementation of a general approach pioneered by Darlington, Guo et al. in their 1995 paper &quot;Functional Skeletons for Parallel Coordination&quot;.

The new developments in BEM++ 3.0 are as follows:

- A new fully cmake based installer than works on a variety of Linux and Mac systems. Optional a Homebrew installer for Mac and binary packages for Ubuntu are provided. For unsupported Linux distributions or Windows systems a Virtualbox virtual machine image is now provided as default to distribute the software. This significantly improved the user experience and allows to use BEM++ within a few minutes from downloading.
- Reduction of external dependencies. We have cleaned up the code base and removed several external dependencies, making the software much easier to install and maintain.
- Redesign of large parts of the library in Python. Originally BEM++ was developed mostly in C++ with a thin Python interface on top. We have reimplemented all non-performance critical parts of the library directly in Python, leaving only low-level assembly loops and multithreaded routines in C++. This has significantly improved the maintainability and extendability of BEM++. One of the postdocs on the project has implemented fast high-frequency preconditioners purely from Python without requiring the need to work in C++.
- Development of our own H-Matrix library. Previously, BEM++ depended on the external AHMED software for fast assembly of large-problems. AHMED has a difficult, not open-source compliant license. We have solved this problem by developing our own hierarchical matrix solutions, which performs excellently and is now fully integrated in BEM++. We have solved very large high-frequency problems from high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment with our new library and achieve excellent performance.
- Development of various preconditioning techniques. We have implemented high-frequency preconditioners for Helmholtz and opposite order preconditioners for Laplace type problems. These are useful in large-scale application problems. The high-frequency preconditioners have already been used in a real world data engineering application.","Software","Yes","2015","While it is too early to gather precise impact data we are pleased that the main paper describing the BEM++ library, which has appeared in Transactions on Mathematical Software in 2015, has been cited 40 times (Google Scholar citations) in its first year, which is a very high number for Mathematics. Also, we regularly observe now other groups at conferences presenting results based on BEM++. As time progresses the citation count of the main BEM++ paper will be some measure on how widely the software continues to be used.","http://www.bempp.org","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56ddff98def817.83136300&grantRef=EP%2FK03829X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/K03829X/1","A26FFBE2-444C-485D-9D94-3FEE9B139842","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","AE036D48-BA31-4D52-8184-B321162F561C"

The basic premises of this tool are;

To provide users of all abilities with real numbers of the notional costs of running molecular dynamics simulations on ARCHER with respect to information that is more familiar to the user such as number of atoms and simulation time etc. 

To provide a tool that the consortium can use to screen applications based on information given during the application process to assess the feasibility of a project achieving stated goals given the size of the resource request.

Changes:
This release focused on releasing the full data set (LAMMPS, NAMD and CHARMM).
Cosmetic update to deal with browser changes (new edge browser).
Security fixes.
Small bug fixes.","Webtool/Application","","2015","This tool has proved to be quite popular amongst the academic community, feedback from members of the community has been very positive for this tool with requests to expand to more codes being quite common.

Hundreds of sensors can be carried by a single individual to enable installation in one go. These sensors are intelligent. They sense their environment and orientation and are self-calibrating. Previously, sensors often required an engineer to reconfigure the firmware according to the situation, and the data that they produced needed to be treated and transformed before producing meaningful results. Other sensors needed careful alignment and to be placed in a predetermined orientation before the sensor could report back alignment data. Utterberry's sensors are simple to use and operate. They measure multiple parameters at once, a single sensor typically measuring seven or more parameters. This rich data set ensures that all important events are recorded such that not only is data being collected and transmitted, but valuable information is being communicated in real-time to the user so that he or she can make important and cost-effective decisions. Utterberry - making sensing perfect. The UtterBerry, an intelligent wireless sensor system using the world's smallest wireless sensors. The UtterBerry has won the Crossrail Best Practice/Innovation Award for contractors Costain-Skanska who deployed the technology at a partially sealed unit complex at its Eleanor Street site in London.

For the VELO, LHCb was first to pioneer and install full-sized n+p sensors; in 2012 we completed production of the first complete LHC vertex detector using this technology. n+p sensors now form the baseline for ATLAS and CMS upgrades and are offered by all major sensor manufacturers (Hamamatsu Photonics, CNM, Micron, etc) as standard to the research, healthcare and aerospace sectors. The VELO production of hybrids by Stevenage Circuits has allowed this company to produce highly thermally-conductive devices for high radiation environments. Hawk electronics (who won an NW industry award for their work) can now compete for further EU contracts on the basis of developing ?low thermal impact? component-placement technologies for the VELO. The VELO detectors were installed as a beam-halo monitor at the Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology leading to cross-over research between tracking detectors and Healthcare.

Modular extensions of rule-based languages allow for more structured models: a module can be defined once and subsequently used in multiple contexts. However, writing models in a modular language can be difficult, especially for modellers with no formal training in computer science. This software output allows for automated modular abstraction of flat rule-based models. The resulting modular abstractions are optimal with respect to a measure of modularity which reflects the decrease in model size resulting from the use of modules.","Software","","2012",,,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-5893753874.9480196fd52bf6&grantRef=EP%2FH027955%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H027955/1","524B40EA-87B7-4DEF-9772-D7B35974D9CD","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","BEC504F7-738C-40D3-B666-88BED1216CB6"

If you have been working on that gene for a while, you most problably know on which chromosome it is. Otherwise find out. Flow sort chromosomes of your wildtype and mutants. Sequence amplified DNA from your chromosomes on Illumina. You need about a HiSeq2000 lane per chromosome. A denovo assembly of the wildtype data will be used as reference.

The study is motivated by the lack of transferable semantic descriptors in music production and the requirement for more intuitive control of low-level parameters, thus providing musicians with easier access to technology.

Thus, the microphone of the 'second screen' device is used to listen to the music playing on the TV, whilst audio fingerprinting technology is used to identify it. Then, a dynamically webpage is generated providing rich information about the music identified, as well as related music and musical artists based on social-cultural factors. The latter is achieved by querying web services such as Youtube, The Echonest, Last.fm and MusicBrainz. Linking and making sense - knowledge inference - out of such wide range and diverse music-related data acquired across multiple sources and services on the web is achieved thanks to C4DM Music Ontology.

However, in normal 'uncalibrated' digital photographs the pixel values do not scale linearly with the amount of light measured by the sensor. This means that pixel values cannot be reliably compared between different photos or even regions within the same photo unless the images are calibrated to be linear and have any lighting changes controlled for.
Some scientists are aware of these issues, but lack convenient, user-friendly software to work with calibrated images, while many others continue to measure uncalibrated images. We have developed a toolbox that can calibrate images using many common consumer digital cameras, and for some cameras the images can be converted to &quot;animal vision&quot;, to measure how the scene might look to non-humans. Many animals can see down into the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, such as most insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, some fish and some mammals, so it is important to measure UV when working with these animals. Our toolbox can combine photographs taken through multiple colour filters, for example allowing you to combine normal photographs with UV photographs and convert to animal vision across their whole range of sensitivities.
The toolbox is free, open source and open access and works with the free programme Image J.

My team in Nottingham has demonstrated the sensitivity of this contrast agent for emphysema (model) related changes in the lung surface. However, this distinct sensitivity also leads to complications in the production of this novel contrast agent for clinical applications. The success of the laser pumping process is measured by the enhancement factor in the MRI sensitivity that is many orders of magnitude above the pre-pumped state. In order to reach this enhancement, xenon-129 or krypton-83 are usually diluted by other gases during laser pumping. For MRI usage, these additional gases are usually removed after the pumping process. However, the gas removal from laser pumped krypton-83 mixture was previously not possible because conventional &quot;cleaning up&quot; methods lead to the complete loss of the hyperpolarized state, rendering the contrast agent useless for MRI. 
We have now solved this problem by diluting krypton-83 in molecular hydrogen gas (H2) for the laser pumping process. After successful laser pumping, the hydrogen gas is removed in a safe and controlled fashion through a catalysed combustion reaction. Water vapour, the sole product of the 'clean' hydrogen reaction, is easily removed through condensation, leaving behind the purified laser-polarized krypton-83 gas diluted only by small remaining quantities of harmless water vapour. This development significantly improves the potential usefulness of laser-pumped krypton-83 as MRI contrast agent for clinical applications. The novel methodology can also be utilized for laser polarized xenon-129 and may lead to a cheaper and more accessible production of this contrast agent.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2016","Has just been completed - no output yet.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56e0259aad4091.81283845&grantRef=G0900785","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0900785","48AA0943-59B9-491F-A272-BF4E71FA09C8","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","936D002F-A8D1-4A93-AE5D-825ED0903D8D","5486FFD2-804B-45DB-8EA9-38A8AE0ACD78"

The use of minimization reduces differences that might arise by chance between the study arms in the distribution of
patient characteristics such as gender, ethnicity and age. However, unlike randomization, minimization requires real time
assessment of each new participant with respect to the preceding distribution of relevant participant characteristics within
the different arms of the study. For multi-site studies, this necessitates centralized computational analysis that is shared
between all study locations. Unfortunately, there is no suitable freely available open source or free software that can be
used for this purpose. OxMaR was developed to enable researchers in any location to use minimization for patient allocation
and to access the minimization algorithm using any device that can connect to the internet such as a desktop computer,
tablet or mobile phone. The software is complete in itself and requires no special packages or libraries to be installed. It is
simple to set up and run over the internet using online facilities which are very low cost or even free to the user.
Importantly, it provides real time information on allocation to the study lead or administrator and generates real time
distributed backups with each allocation. OxMaR can readily be modified and customised and can also be used for standard
randomization. It has been extensively tested and has been used successfully in a low budget multi-centre study. Hitherto,
the logistical difficulties involved in minimization have precluded its use in many small studies and this software should
allow more widespread use of minimization which should lead to studies with better matched control and experimental
arms. OxMaR should be particularly valuable in low resource settings.","Software","Yes","2014","The software has already been used successfully in one clinical trial - OxCKD1 which has now completed recruitment and is in the follow up phase.","http://sourceforge.net/projects/oxmar/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=545367a099d588.71118206&grantRef=G116%2F165","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G116/165","6DF2A95E-D33C-41BA-A692-EF1965565F4D","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","6B2DF52A-FCE9-4C50-B8A5-372AFE1D40DC"

The system can monitor location, rider control data and other custom sensor input in real time. SEMS is designed to run from the e-bike battery, and requires no intervention from the rider.
The SEMS data feeds an online interface for (1) data analysis and (2) for riders to view their own data. The smart e-bike monitoring system is designed as an autonomous, modular and flexible system - the basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research.
The source code and hardware design are publicly available for non-commercial use under the GPL. The repository is part of documenting and communicating it. We have open-sourced the monitor system so that it may be used by other e-bike and GPS monitoring projects.","Webtool/Application","","2012","SEMS has allowed us to monitor in detail how much trial participants have used their e-bikes (GPS) and how they used the assistance levels, for 100 trial participants, each using the bike for 6-8 weeks in 2012 and 2013.

Second, the intrinsic nature of the new methods and techniques (Mass Spectrometry imaging, MSI) require different sets of data and metadata matrixes, which must be adapted to the ISA-Tab format.

Currently, we are participating in the definition and implementation of a new Python-based ISA-API library, which will support the programmatic creation of ISA objects, multiple ISA serializations (e.g. tabular and JSON representations) and conversions between ISA and other formats (e.g. SRA xml).","Webtool/Application","","2015","Data files within metabolomics studies can become rather large, taking to much time in the process of online submission, sometimes producing connection time outs. In order to prevent this we are providing a mechanism for failsafe and resumable online transfer of large study data to MetaboLights, benefiting small or large labs equally. Submitters can use the ftp protocol, with longer connection time that regular http, or use an Aspera client application. Aspera is being assumed as the general procedure for the future.

We are actively participating in the new ISATab developments, leaded by the ISATeam at Oxford, are being done on JSON schemas and JSON representation for ISA-Tab. A python-based ISA-API with components for parsing and converting between ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON, will be available soon and a working prototype is being tested now. The conversion from Metabolomics Workbench to ISA-tab will be carried out by a python script that relies on BeautifulSoup parser. This script is being developed to produce ISA objects, that way the actual serialization mechanism can be decided later. In addition, the ISAconverter tool has implemented ISA-Tab to SRA-xml and a opposite conversion from SRA-xml to ISA-Tab.","https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56d84a8eecf7b7.12016513&grantRef=BB%2FL024152%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/L024152/1","8AD6A9A2-2491-422B-996F-E5113E267B21","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","9A22541F-DA58-481E-8D0C-C4BCF4EA030E","C3D1978C-F406-4C37-84AD-AABB38267132"

Despite the substantial resources required for open data, there is an expectation that making data accessible will drive innovation and strengthen the economy. The Open Data Institute (ODI) and Nesta, the UK's innovation charity, claim that open data could strengthen the UK economy with a five to ten fold return on every pound invested.

The impetus for this project was the realisation there remains a significant gap between the availability of raw data from UK government websites and the ability to use this data in a research or business context. Substantial resources are currently being wasted through the need for individuals to carry out numerous repetitive manual tasks in order to obtain data in an appropriate format. By providing suitable data science techniques, we show that it is possible to bring raw data to life by offering summary statistics, extremes, distributions and trends. We also offer a user-friendly download portal and application programming interface (API) to facilitate developers.

The Met Office is the national weather service in the UK. Weather, climate and environmental data have been identified as a key priority for the UK's open data program. DataPoint is a service to access freely available Met Office data feeds in a format that is suitable for application developers. We focus on long-term historical weather observations at a monthly time scale for 33 stations in the UK. The Climate Historic database provides observations on maximum and minimum temperature, rainfall, sunlight and air frost.

This project demonstrates how to bridge the gap between raw data and usable data in a refined and structured format. We welcome feedback on how this process could be improved and scaled up to include other datasets. Input from practitioners that need to use weather and climate data would be particularly useful.","Webtool/Application","","2015","Private sector practitioners have used the website to access climate data

However, recent functional genomic experiments have challenged the traditional view of pathways as independent functional entities. Combining information from pathway databases and interaction networks is therefore a promising strategy to obtain more robust pathway and process representations.

PathExpand is a methodology for extending pre-defined protein sets representing cellular pathways and processes by mapping them onto a protein-protein interaction network, and expanding them to include densely interconnected interaction partners. The added proteins display distinctive network topological features and molecular function annotations, and can be proposed as putative new pathway components, and/or as regulators of the communication between different cellular processes.","Webtool/Application","","2010","--","http://www.pathexpand.org/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5463648543ec56.47382254&grantRef=BB%2FF01855X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/F01855X/1","FD558DB9-D915-4E22-88B6-DD6F2351CB6E","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","936D002F-A8D1-4A93-AE5D-825ED0903D8D","21C6DDE0-BAD0-4BE9-BC4D-6C9C3E5BC98C"

While BMAC focused on delivering tools to support parents to record observable behaviours, this new technology promotes a self-management paradigm by encouraging young people with ASD to take responsibility to recognised and record their own behaviours. 

There is growing recognition of the need for effective intervention and support to reduce the risk of children and young people with ASD from being excluded from society and in particular from education. This follow-on research is investigating contemporary approaches for providing 'virtual' support to young people with ASD that will complement existing approaches, which enable self-management and 'self-coping' with everyday challenges.

The service is based around a smartphone App that provides users with task management, life-logging, reminding, and travel support. The App is supported via a dedicated web portal that promotes collaboration between caregivers and their dependents, towards defining obtainable life goals.","Webtool/Application","","2015","Based on the feedback from 20 participants (4 parents (Phase one), 8 child-parent groupings (Phase two)), the findings positively support the potential utility of LifePal, however, highlight the importance of delivering sufficient user training to support adoption and the need for longitudinal evaluations.

Among the most highly rated features were both life-logging and the rewards service which included the facility to generate a personalised contract between the parent and child. Another interesting observation was that younger users found the App easy to use while parents reported a learning curve associated with the web portal. In terms of qualitative feedback, parents praised the concepts of the platform, high-lighting the advantages of delivering services via technology in comparison with paper-based approaches. They also indicated that LifePal added structure to their child's day, allowing them to know what lay ahead and provided them with a safe space to life-log in a non-verbal way.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56cc611fe76e24.21292855&grantRef=EP%2FK014420%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/K014420/1","5AB5A8A9-A075-4906-915C-BA9333B83FE1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","245EB81A-808F-4697-BAED-263C20266B74","41701417-93C5-41CB-8612-17483EBD0FFA"

Users of power-hungry devices can reduce their energy costs by purchasing power through a Time of Use (ToU) tariff, which is implemented via this new control software that is being developed in the ESCoBox project. There are a number of ways of doing this, but in the ESCoBox project we have narrowed these down to one option, which is to sell allotted time-slots to high power users. This is to gain the greatest benefit with the greatest simplicity, as complex arrangements are less likely to be taken up by customers. The program is currently being developed and tested on a Raspbery-Pi platform to allow a low-cost, widely-deployable solution. It is intended that this software will be made Open Source.","Software","","2015","The primary use of this controller will be in implementing time-slot allocations to high power demand loads on power-limited mini-grids, such as those supplied from hydro-electric generators. This technique reduces the chance of overloading the system at peak demand periods by activating power supply circuits to high-power load at pre-allocated time-slots during off-peak periods. This allows more customers to be served at lower cost to them, while increasing reliability of the mini-grid and improving the operator's Return on Investment (ROI) by keeping the system running closer to full capacity. It can also be applied to energy-limited mini-grids, such as those supplied from wind or solar generators. In this situation, the time-slots are sold at preferential rates during periods of high solar (or wind) input. This reduces reliance on batteries, allowing smaller (and cheaper) battery banks, which are put under much less stress so that they last longer. Thus blackouts and battery damage are reduced as are lifetime costs and therefore customer tariffs.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54620ed2bfee75.25165225&grantRef=EP%2FL002566%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/L002566/1","A45D25CE-53E0-4746-BCFC-066D772BD2FB","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","DF259B19-FD17-4588-BFEF-AD08F1193451","7B2ED505-A03E-4298-B19C-DAAE64EA15C6"

This capital award facilitated the purchase of a cluster of data-processing servers and replacement web servers. These systems have been installed and integrated into our operations. The processing servers are used for converting EO data we receive directly from satellites into environmental science products in near real-time. They have significantly improved our capability to do this so that products are available to our users and NEODAAS partners shortly after data have been received from the satellites. This is critical for users with near-real time data requirements such as marine research cruises, research aircraft flights and assessing weather conditions.

Force feedback devices are widely used for a diverse range of application including 3D modeling, medical simulations, games and virtual sculpture. Normally these applications are based on a 3D vector graphics (e.g. OpenGL) scene which is &quot;augmented&quot; with sense of touch, namely the possibility to touch the virtual objects that are rendered on the screen.
 
However, a relatively unexplored field is the use of such devices to provide a haptic modality of interaction with everyday programs featuring a 2D graphical user interface made of buttons, lists, menus etc. Such a modality, besides opening up new ways of interacting with graphical user interfaces, would have an impact on the access to common software by people with visual impairments.
 
The JHapticGUI library helps building such software in Java. It provides an abstract and clean interface to the haptic device from the Java code allowing at the same time full freedom as to how to design the haptic scene. It takes care of the synchronization between the Java event dispatching thread and the thread that handles the device. Furthermore it provides a communication protocol based on general purpose messages for connecting haptic and graphic events. Details of communication implementation are hidden to the client code but the content of the message can be defined by the application, for maximum customization of the program logic","Software","Yes","2015","Provides a new way to make accessible interfaces","http://depic.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/?q=jhapticgui","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56cf2664b0a905.70824109&grantRef=EP%2FJ017205%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/J017205/1","F4D74878-22A6-497B-A524-0C690E80F817","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","058B7945-94E9-450F-A970-E88BA39F33D9"

Energy-expending/energy-influencing features, from windows and lights to cooker hob rings and a central heating thermostat can be interacted with (opened/closed; turned on/off, etc.). Wall and roof insulation materials can be selected, different forms of light bulbs are available and the 3D can be viewed in &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;night vision&quot; and &quot;thermal mode&quot;. The task of the end user is to explore the apartment and modify the dwelling's thermal expenditure qualities. The users' results are displayed at the end of each session. In addition to the &quot;desktop&quot; implementation of the Virtual Apartment (I.e. standard PC/laptop interface), the prototype can be experienced using so-called &quot;immersive&quot; VR techniques, via an Oculus Rift head-mounted display and Xbox controller, or on a Samsung S6 Smartphone, integrated with a Samsung GearVR headset and associated hand controller.","Software","","2015","- Studies using the eViz VR flat have so far led to a paper published in the conference proceedings of BEHAVE 2014, and a journal paper is under review.

The software was originally devised for and in collaboration with adult users of cochlear implants. 
Aim: To enhance the user's potential for participating in conversations (a) passively as recipient / listener; (b) actively as speaker.
Objectives:
1) To raise user's awareness of how conversation works, with specific reference to turn-taking and overlap
2) To provide structured practice in listening and speaking in a variety of turn-taking contexts
MODULE 1: Taking part in conversations
Phase 1: How to use 'Talking in Time' 
Phase 2: How conversations work: Mechanics of turn-taking
Phase 3: Participating in conversations effectively: Cues to turn-taking
MODULE 2: Clear turns 
Phase 1: Awareness - identifying the gender of speakers in multiparty talk
Phase 2: Listening - identifying a clear (non-overlapping) turn taken on time vs. turn taken late
Phase 3: Speaking - taking a clear turn on time (i.e. not early or late)
MODULE 3: Competitive overlaps 
Phase 1: Awareness - identifying multiple speakers talking in sequence vs. one speaker
Phase 2: Listening - distinguishing competitive overlaps from clear transitions
Phase 3: Speaking - taking a competitive overlapping turn 
MODULE 4: Accidental overlaps
Phase 1: Awareness - becoming familiar with the features that characterise competitive, collaborative and accidental overlaps
Phase 2: Listening - identifying if an overlap is intentional-competitive vs. intentional-collaborative vs. accidental 
Phase 3: Speaking - dropping out immediately on finding oneself accidentally in overlap","Software","Yes","2016","A preliminary version of the software was demonstrated at the end-of-project event, where it was trialled by a small group of cochlear implant users.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56dd5fa40f4b56.62496182&grantRef=AH%2FL009307%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=AH/L009307/1","8587C0A8-E721-40B3-8A59-1EE48DE043E3","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","5CD7F7FB-8502-4E79-8344-1501805DFC64"

However, in normal 'uncalibrated' digital photographs the pixel values do not scale linearly with the amount of light measured by the sensor. This means that pixel values cannot be reliably compared between different photos or even regions within the same photo unless the images are calibrated to be linear and have any lighting changes controlled for.
Some scientists are aware of these issues, but lack convenient, user-friendly software to work with calibrated images, while many others continue to measure uncalibrated images. We have developed a toolbox that can calibrate images using many common consumer digital cameras, and for some cameras the images can be converted to &quot;animal vision&quot;, to measure how the scene might look to non-humans. Many animals can see down into the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, such as most insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, some fish and some mammals, so it is important to measure UV when working with these animals. Our toolbox can combine photographs taken through multiple colour filters, for example allowing you to combine normal photographs with UV photographs and convert to animal vision across their whole range of sensitivities.
The toolbox is free, open source and open access and works with the free programme Image J.

The primary functions of DL_FIELD are:

(1) Force field model convertor: DL_FIELD converts user's atom models, in particular those of large complex biomolecular systems, into file formats that are recognisable and ready to run in DL_POLY_Classic, DL_POLY_3 and DL_POLY_4 programs with minimum user's intervention. This basically involves the conversion of a user's atomic configuration in simple xyz coordinates into identifiable atom types base on a particular user-selectable potential schemes and then automatically generate the DL_POLY configuration file (CONFIG), the force field file (FIELD) and a generic control file (CONTROL).

(2) Force field editor: DL_FIELD allows user to edit or modify a particular force field scheme to produce a customised scheme that is specific to a particular simulation model. For instance, introduction of pseudo points and rigid body implementation to an otherwise standard potential scheme such as CHARMM or AMBER, etc.

(3) Force field model repertoire: DL_FIELD has a consistent file structure format for all FF schemes and molecular structure definitions. It also allows user to easily expand the existing standard model library to include user-defined molecular model.

(4) Full automatic atom typesetting (the DLF notation) and identification of chemical nature of atoms.","Software","Yes","2015","Widely distributed package including academia and industrial users.","http://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/SCD/research/app/ccg/software/DL_FIELD/40633.aspx","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56d8a4a658cfa4.55033392&grantRef=EP%2FM022617%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/M022617/1","6BD6DF59-41DD-4687-8FCE-46B5714D315E","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","670538DA-5B47-4CD2-940F-203E8484DB9B"

With additional support from a BESS Programme Knowledge Exchange grant (NE/M000206/1), we have developed a biodiversity module for the Cool Farm Tool. It uses a scoring system for farms to rapidly assess their overall management of biodiversity, based on rigorous, unbiased assessment of evidence for the effectiveness of specific actions (Dicks et al.

Since part of our exploitation strategy is to collect more clinical autofluorescence lifetime data in a number of different clinical contexts, we would like to replicate our SAFE functionality ion lower costs systems that could be deployed in parallel in different hospital settings. Accordingly, we have worked to reduce the cost of the electronic circuitry required to determine the autofluorescence lifetimes. For this we have developed a relatively simple frequency domain system utilising excitation light from a blue GaN diode laser and have implemented frequency domain detection using a programmable FPGA. This has the potential to significantly reduce the cost and the size of our instrumentation such that we can make a number of low-cost systems for parallel clinical trials.

This was based on the Mauna Kea Technologies Cellvisio? system, which we developed into a self-contained trolley based instrument incorporating a tunable ultrafast excitation laser (based on a frequency-doubled Ti:Sapphire laser) and implemented time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) detection. We wrote the acquisition and analysis software and demonstrated the capability to image (mouse) tissue expressing CFY, YFP and GFFP in real-time (~Hz). This confocal FLIM endomicroscope can be configured with outside diameters of less than 2 mm, providing access to many internal organs in humans and animals. 



For animal imaging the is tremendous potential impact for drug discovery, preclinical imaging and basic biomedical research if cell signalling processes could be read out in real time in live disease models using Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET) to study protein-protein interactions. To this end we showed that our instrument can realise FLIM FRET of live cells in expressing GFP and mCherry constructs and we are working with the CRUL London Research Institute to translate this to in vivo experiments. We are also working to apply this to clinical imaging of cancer with exogenous probes such as PPIX induced by ALA-5, for which we have an ongoing collaboration with St Mary?s Hospital. 



We extensively evaluated this instrument for label-free imaging of tissue autofluorescence but unfortunately fluorescence is excited in the glass fibre bundles at the same wavelengths as biological tissue is effectively excited for clinical readouts (i.e. in the u.v./blue) and the unwanted background fluorescence from the fibre-optic bundle swamps the tissue autofluorescence.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2010","This endoscope has the potential to enable FLIM to be applied in vivo, including in animal models.

In this study the median was used as the threshold Td in the sequence conversion, given that the me-dian is robust to outliers [Na02]. A sequence P = s(1), s(2),?, s(n) is created by comparison the original signal with the threshold, with s(i) given by: 
 (1)
Once this coarse-grained sequence has been created from the original signal, P is scanned from left to right and the complexity counter c(n) is increased by one unit every time a new subsequence of consecutive characters is encountered. A detailed description of the complexity algorithm can be found in [Zh01].
The complexity algorithm is dependent on the sequence length. For this reason, c(n) should be normalized. For a sequence of length n and an alphabet of ? symbols, the upper bound of c(n) is given by [LZ76]: 
 (2)
where ?n is a small quantity and ?n ? 0 (n ? ?). In general,

Therefore, c(n) can be normalized via b(n):

The two players will have to collaborate to achieve this task in a present time of two minutes.","Software","","2013",,,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-1750631902.13463456fd5953c&grantRef=EP%2FH003738%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H003738/1","81E9F6A1-37A7-4823-9F11-45AB6D754FDA","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","ED6ACD61-0140-4C05-B93D-2C6A42CA753B","B4D92884-8438-477A-8428-73EFA2F60CDD"

There are two ways to use the app - firstly visitors can tour the cemetery remotely from the comfort of their own homes using a digital map, and select the graves to discover the stories of the people buried there, how they lived and where they came from. Secondly they can go to Welford Road Cemetery itself, which is about a mile south of Leicester city center, on the A5199 Welford Road and use the app while walking around the impressive monumental sculptures of the cemetery. There are nearly 200 individual graves and monuments stored in the app with more being added by theFriends of the Welford Road Cemetery for whom it was created. The app was created by Nick Higgett and Thom Corah at De Montfort University's Digital Building Heritage Group.","Webtool/Application","","2013","This mobile device app for iOS devices has been used as an exemplar of co-production of digital community heritage assets in Leicester.

This democratisation of access to large-scale data has allowed many research teams to plan to assemble the genomes of non-model organisms. These new genome targets are very different from the traditional, inbred, laboratory reared model organisms. They are often small, and cannot be isolated free of their environment - whether ingested food, the surrounding host organism of parasites, or commensal and symbiotic organisms attached to or within the individuals sampled. Preparation of pure DNA originating from a single species can be technically impossible, but assembly of mixed-organism DNA can be difficult, as most genome assemblers perform poorly when faced with multiple genomes in different stoichiometries. This class of problem is common in metagenomic datasets that deliberately try to capture all the genomes present in an environment, but replicon assembly is not often the goal of such programmes. Here we present an approach to extracting from mixed DNA sequence data subsets that correspond to single species' genomes and thus improving genome assembly. We use both numerical (proportion of GC bases and read coverage) and biological (best-matching sequence in annotated databases) indicators to aid partitioning of draft assembly contigs, and the reads that contribute to those contigs, into distinct bins that can then be subjected to rigorous, optimised assembly. We also present a tool, blobsplorer, that aids exploration and selection of subsets from GC/coverage/taxonomy annotated datasets. Partitioning the data in this way &quot;rescues&quot; poorly assembled genomes, and reveals unexpected symbionts and commensals in eukaryotic genome projects. The TAGC-plot pipeline script is available from http://github.com/blaxterlab/blobology, and the Blobsplorer tool from https://github.com/mojones/blobsplorer.","Software","Yes","2013","Blobsplorer/TAGC plots are now in wide use in genomics.

Input for the period 1973 to 2006 are ICOADS Release 2.4 ship data and the update from 2007 to 2011 uses ICOADS Release 2.5. The dataset is presented as a time series of monthly mean values on a 1 degree area grid. Included variables are: heat fluxes (sensible, latent, shortwave radiation, longwave radiation), air temperature, sea surface temperature, wind speed, specific humidity, pressure and cloud cover. The quality of the gridded data is quantified by estimates of random, bias and total uncertainty. The monthly means were derived from daily estimates of each variable and the standard deviation of these daily values is also available. Users are advised to take account of the uncertainty estimates provided, and to note that in very poorly sampled regions, such as the Southern Ocean, the uncertainty estimates themselves may be unreliable. Surface meteorological fields have been adjusted to account for varying measurement heights and for known biases.

Changes:

1. longbow commands now have a well defined format of: longbow [longbow arguments] executable [executableargs].
2. The parameter hierarchy has changed such that now parameters provided on the Longbow command line will overrule the same parameters in configuration files.
3. The -stage longbow argument is no longer supported as Longbow will automatically detect additional input files.
4. The rsync --include and --exclude have been exposed so that users can mask out files they do not need. These are separated into upload and downloads by using the following parameters; upload-include, upload-exclude, download-include and download-exclude. Only the download variants are available to the user (upload variants are used internally within Longbow but developers can make use of them in the API).
5. For replicate jobs, the order in which Longbow will search for input files has changed such that it looks in the repX subdirectories before the current working directory.
6. The batch parameter has been renamed replicates.
7. The commandline parameter has been renamed executableargs.
8. The parameters replicates (formerly batch) and jobname can now be provided on the Longbow command line as longbow arguments. 9. jobname is an exception as it is the only parameter that cannot overrule the jobname provided in the job configuration file.
10. LongbowExamples is now downloaded to the current working directory rather than the home directory when downloaded using longbow -examples.
Jobs now run on the remote resource in /remoteworkdir/jobnameXXXXX where XXXXX represents a random 5-digit number. This is to prevent jobs with the same jobname clashing on the remote resource.
Bugs have been fixed such that jobs will run on remote resources that use the SGE_ARC2 scheduler.

It contains a forward solver module using the finite element method for simulating the propagation of light in highly scattering, inhomogeneous biological tissues, such as the brain.
The inverse solver module uses an iterative, model-based approach to reconstruct the unknown distributions of absorption and scattering coefficients in the volume of interest from boundary measurements of light transmission.
Toast++ consists of a set of libraries written in C++ for sparse linear algebra, finite element computation, and nonlinear image reconstruction. Several command line applications for forward modelling and inverse solution are included. Users who need additional functionality can write their own applications and link to the core Toast++ libraries.
In addition, Toast++ contains bindings for Matlab and Python. This provides a set of functions for accessing the Toast methods from within these scripting environments, without loss of performance. Using Toast++ from within Matlab or Python provides a user-friendly way for quickly adapting Toast to a specific reconstruction problem. It allows rapid prototyping, debugging and visualisation.
The Toast++ sources are distributed with a GPL license. In addition to the sources, binary distributions for various computing platforms can be downloaded.

We present SurreyFBA, which provides constraint-based simulations and network map visualization in a free, stand-alone software. In addition to basic simulation protocols, the tool also implements the analysis of minimal substrate and product sets, which is useful for metabolic engineering and prediction of nutritional requirements in complex in vivo environments, but not available in other commonly used programs. The SurreyFBA is based on a command line interface to the GLPK solver distributed as binary and source
code for the three major operating systems. The command line tool, implemented in C++, is easily executed within scripting languages used in the bioinformatics community and provides efficient implementation of tasks requiring iterative calls to the linear programming solver.

This consists of an axial map layer, representing the urban street network, and an unlinks layer, indicating bridges and tunnels with no level crossing. The module offers a verification tool to check the geometric and topological integrity of each layer, helping correct any problems before running the analysis. The axial and segment analysis is performed in depthmapXnet, via a direct link from QGIS, which receives and prepares the results once the calculations are completed. The &quot;Attributes explorer&quot; module supports the visual and statistical exploration of the analysis results. It provides quick analysis of individual quantitative attributes of a selected layer, mapping the values using simplified symbology settings, displaying essential descriptive statistics, and plotting basic interactive charts (histogram and scatter plot).","https://github.com/SpaceGroupUCL/qgisSpaceSyntaxToolkit","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54575ec1476dd7.95094483&grantRef=EP%2FG02619X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/G02619X/1","79474502-7CDF-48F9-B4E2-5604FA926454","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","123D5014-1D59-460B-91B9-AD274A3D0FB9"

An inevitability property says that a region of the state space will eventually be reached: this is a type of liveness property from the computer science viewpoint, and is related to attractivity of sets in dynamical systems. It is available at

Hundreds of sensors can be carried by a single individual to enable installation in one go. These sensors are intelligent. They sense their environment and orientation and are self-calibrating. Previously, sensors often required an engineer to reconfigure the firmware according to the situation, and the data that they produced needed to be treated and transformed before producing meaningful results. Other sensors needed careful alignment and to be placed in a predetermined orientation before the sensor could report back alignment data. Utterberry's sensors are simple to use and operate. They measure multiple parameters at once, a single sensor typically measuring seven or more parameters. This rich data set ensures that all important events are recorded such that not only is data being collected and transmitted, but valuable information is being communicated in real-time to the user so that he or she can make important and cost-effective decisions.

Here, we discuss these and review the general protocol that is used to simultaneously collect information on geographical movements, diving behaviour and in-situ oceanographic information from marine mammals.This should ahelp other developers to develop ocean platforms of ocean observing.","http://animalbiotelemetry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40317-015-0053-8","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56dd853c652529.79490310&grantRef=NE%2FC00311X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=NE/C00311X/1","9A54E582-6284-47F7-A856-39C1DC759560","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","C0E4FAD2-3C8B-410A-B6DF-3B9B9E433060","6B0810F9-E589-4469-9768-5F23BE58B3BB"

The system represents the combination of three models, which can, if required, be run separately. It has been designed to assess the combined impact of climate, land use and groundwater abstraction changes on river, drainage and groundwater flows, groundwater levels and, where appropriate, SWI. The approach is interdisciplinary and reflects an integrated water management approach. The system comprises three packages: the Distributed Catchment Scale Model, DiCaSM, MODFLOW and SWI models. In addition to estimating all water balance components, DiCaSM, produces the recharge data that are used as input to the groundwater flow model of the US Geological Survey, MODFLOW. The latter subsequently generates the head distribution and groundwater flows that are used as input to the SWI model. Thus, any changes in land use, rainfall, water management, abstraction, etc. at the surface are first handled by DiCaSM, then by MODFLOW and finally by the SWI. The three models operate at different spatial and temporal scales and a facility (interface utilities between models) to aggregate/disaggregate input/output data to meet a desired spatial and temporal scale was developed allowing smooth and easy communication between the three models. MODFLOW and SWI are in the public domain. DiCaSM, has been developed for unsaturated zone at Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, CEH and equally important, is the interfacing utilities between the three models. DiCaSM simulates a number of hydrological processes: rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, infiltration, soil water movement in the root zone, plant water uptake, crop growth, stream flow and groundwater recharge. Input requirements include distributed data sets of rainfall, climate data, land use, soil types and elevation. The model produces distributed and time series output of all water balance components including potential evapotranspiration, actual evapotranspiration, rainfall interception, infiltration, plant water uptake, transpiration, soil water content, soil moisture (SM) deficit, groundwater recharge rate, stream flow and surface runoff. The first version was released in 2010 ( Ragab and Bromley, 2010) but under the Dry project, it has been subjected to further developments that included: 
1. Adding two options to calculate base flow 
2. Accounting for abstractions, irrigation and discharges from other sources such as treated wastewater
3. Using SQL server instead of Microsoft Access 
4. Adding fast calibration option
6. Adding more figure plotting facility e.g. base flow
7. Adding two extra &quot;Goodness of fit parameters&quot; to the
 classical Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE namely the 
 coefficient of determination, R2 and the NSE based on 
 logarithmic values of the observed and simulated stream flows","Software","","2016","The early version of 2010 has been applied on the Pang catchment in the UK and on other catchments in Cyprus, Italy and Brazil to study the impact of climate change and land use changes on water resources. The studies highlighted the gap between supply and demand in those catchments up to 2050. Also quantified the possible impact of climate change on water resources. Particular interest was given to impact of changing land use to account for more durum wheat areas in Italy, use of Sugar Cane as biofuel in Brazil on water resources. The results were published and communicated by the National Researchers to their authorities in those countries for actions. More details can be found at:

For example, the toolkit explains how we used the Freedom of Information Act to collect data for allotments across the UK. At a more local level, if you are interested in setting up a growing project on a plot of unused land in your neighbourhood, how you might go about finding out who owns the land. And then, how you could start sharing your vision with others. Please see the full set of options in the top right corner.

Although the toolkit is presented in a sequence, in principle assuming you may want to start from scratch (getting started), this may not be true for everybody or may only be true for a few people.

Silica dissolution is assumed to be dependent on temperature and on the ratio between silica and carbon in the particles. Si:C ratio represents the magnitude of the organic coat which reduces the dissolution of silica (i.e. low Si:C ratios decrease the dissolution rate). In this way, the model accounts for the role played by pelagic bacteria in this process. Bacteria, in fact, are able to increase the Si:C ratio in particulate organic matter by only using C and leaving Si.","Software","","2015","This new development improves the representation of Si dynamics in ERSEM",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56cee727c24b50.43510723&grantRef=NE%2FK001876%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=NE/K001876/1","16E81AF4-2727-4569-B3D5-5D6080B023CD","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","EEF9EA95-341D-48C2-8A68-B838D35497C8","7300F58C-5309-42D5-A146-F806C5FA7814"

Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies have made it possible to generate transcriptome data for novel organisms quickly and cheaply, to the extent that the effort required to annotate and publish a new transcriptome is greater than the effort required to sequence it. Often, following publication, details of the annotation effort are only available in summary form, hindering subsequent exploitation of the data. To promote best-practice in annotation and to ensure that data remain accessible, we have written afterParty, a web application that allows users to assemble, annotate and publish novel transcriptomes using only a web browser.
Results
afterParty is a robust web application that implements best-practice transcriptome assembly, annotation, browsing, searching, and visualization. Users can turn a collection of reads (from Roche 454 chemistry) or assembled contigs (from any sequencing chemistry, including Illumina Solexa RNA-Seq) into a searchable, browsable transcriptome resource and quickly make it publicly available. Contigs are functionally annotated based on similarity to known sequences and protein domains. Once assembled and annotated, transcriptomes derived from multiple species or libraries can be compared and searched. afterParty datasets can either be created using the existing afterParty server, or using local instances that can be easily built using a virtual machine. afterParty includes powerful visualization tools for transcriptome dataset exploration and uses a flexible annotation architecture which will allow additional types of annotation to be added in the future.
Conclusions
afterParty's main use case scenario is one in which a working biologist has generated a large volume of transcribed sequence data and wishes to turn it into a useful resource that has some durability. By reducing the effort, bioinformatics skills, and computational resources needed to annotate and publish a transcriptome, afterParty will facilitate the annotation and sharing of sequence data that would otherwise remain unavailable. A typical metazoan transcriptome containing several tens of thousands of contigs can be annotated in a few minutes of interactive time and a few days of computational time.","Software","Yes","2013","AfterParty now has a community of users worldwide.","http://afterparty.bio.ed.ac.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5460dd8951cf15.16610348&grantRef=BB%2FI023585%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/I023585/1","6D956717-10CC-4E14-B564-685593CACD09","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","1CE33A3A-C5BC-45B1-A130-BDEB55935C70"

The development of this app was a collaborative co-production project between De Montfort University's Digital Building Heritage Group, the Department of Archaeology at the University of Nottingham (Co-Investigator Dr Chris King) and the Southwell Community Archaeology Group (SCAG). The objective was to create a new, prototype mobile device app which would allow finds and other information to be uploaded by users to 3D representations of archaeological and historical sites and then explored in an intuitive way. The idea behind this was to give community heritage groups' greater opportunities to interpret their own finds and present them in a way which would allow these groups to shape the stories about the archaeology they were involved with. There are two key new concepts in this prototype app which makes it different from other data-base archaeology apps that are available and which make a significant advance in the functionality and use-ability of apps on archaeological sites for heritage interpretation. The first is the ability for registered users to upload finds data to an on-line Content Management System (CMS). This is done over the internet using a normal web-browser. Information about finds and the archaeology to upload can be text, images, video and audio. These finds data can be geo-located in three dimensions using a graphic x,y,z slider bar system in the app to very precise points in 3D on the archaeological site by the user during the upload. By pressing an update button on the app screen, the new finds data are uploaded from the server and become clickable hot-spots in the app on the iPAD which shows the finds data in a new screen and also signals that there is new data for existing hot-spots. The hot spots move with the 3D model of the building as you rotate it around. There is also a Google Map view which allows you see the hot-spots in 2D in map form which is good for very large sites. The second innovation in these apps is the use of 3D reconstructions of the buildings associated with the finds and the way they are presented. The hot-spots appear in three dimensions in the buildings. In order to reveal ones inside structures or in walls and floors or underground there is a clever section slider which allows the user to see inside the buildings and their walls and floors. In this way it really is like digging down and through the building to reveal the locations of finds so that you can click on them. The app is free to download from Apple's App Store and at present are available for Apple's iPad only. Search for &quot;Southwell&quot; in the App Store.","Webtool/Application","","2015","A principle impact from the use of this app has been that it has significantly contributed to saving the remains of a unique 19th century &quot;House of Correction&quot; in Southwell and its sensitive incorporation into a new urban development plan. Part of the remains of this historic building are to become a heritage centre. The results from the development process and testing of this app have shown that public interest in using apps for archaeology is increasingly rapidly in the UK and both professional and community archaeologists find it useful to present their work to public audiences, often on site, to show how exciting finds can inform the understanding of the communities and landscapes where we live. It has been shown that presenting individual artefacts using the app can help bring the past back to life and engage members of the public in with the heritage of their built environment to an extent not previously common. The development and testing of the app has also highlighted areas which although functional would bear further development to make the easier to use by those with little or no prior experience, in particular uploading artefact data to the app's Content Management System (CMS).","https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/historic-southwell/id1005018705?mt=8","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56d44a6fb11365.64448224&grantRef=AH%2FL013290%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=AH/L013290/1","EB3F693D-F6B3-42A6-85BB-698035E46444","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","DF259B19-FD17-4588-BFEF-AD08F1193451","2503091D-A6F6-479F-9B28-2EDB216D43D0"

Martin Briddon, engineering manager, JFM, said: &quot;This research has helped enormously with deeper signal processing than was currently undertaken and has resulted in a deeper understanding of machinery fault situations. We are now able to use the knowledge and information to develop new ways of searching for machinery faults amongst a clutter of normal operational data.&quot;","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2015","Mimic condition-monitoring software allows ship operators to base maintenance decisions on condition and performance rather than on recommended time basis.

The MODE VLE will introduce multimodal methods for analysing communication and learning with digital technologies.

There will be five units of self-supported study that introduce four theoretical perspectives: social action; moving image and film; design, genre and interactivity; and embodied cognition.

It is recommended that the course is started by completing the induction unit. This section will provide a tutorial on how to navigate the course structure and access the course contents. The introductory unit is optional and recommended for those who are new to multimodal methods or would like a refresher on key concepts and issues. Any of the other units can be selected to further explore topics related to research interests. 

Units 1-5 are organised thematically but can also be explored chronologically for those interested in a full course. Each unit is comprised of key readings, guides, case studies and research resources. See the outline below for further details. 

MODE VLE Programme Outline:
Unit 1: An introduction to multimodal methodologies
Unit 2: Analysing video recorded face-to-face interaction
Unit 3: Analysing embodied cognition and interaction with tangible and mobile devices
Unit 4: Analysing digital text making in digital and online environments
Unit 5: Analysing moving image and digital film production

Each unit will provide readings, learning resources, key concepts and activities to offer both conceptual and applied understanding of the multimodal methods outlined and the theoretical perspectives explored. Case studies and examples drawn from MODE research will also be available for guided instruction of research conducted in different environments, including hospitals, schools, galleries and online platforms. The technologies we explore include digital video devices, Web 2.0 technologies, and mobile and tangible devices.

Participants enrolled in this online course have the option to explore all units as an introductory overview or may opt to focus on one or two of the units for more in-depth study of the particular approaches detailed. Videos, visual timelines, transcription banks and glossaries are among the embedded resources in the unit lessons.","Webtool/Application","","2015","The launch is forthcoming (in 2015), however we have already received many enquiries about its availability for students and researchers.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=557b0caabc2586.83165003&grantRef=ES%2FI02445X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=ES/I02445X/1","C2DC06A4-98A7-4ABC-AFD1-680192069ACC","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","0D34D81A-A62C-4B11-8A90-ACB670C0AE91","A229AF1C-73AE-48AA-84CA-F52588594762"

The code and model setups presented have been developed as a community modelling tool for the NERC Defra UK Shelf Sea Biogeochemistry program. The first release of the model provides a baseline model version upon which we can build and develop new process model descriptions, drawing on the experimental and observational activities undertaken by the wider community. We see developing a better synergy between modelling and experimental studies as key to progress over the next decade, hence this system can by run on a PC and provides an entry level modelling tool for non-specialist modellers to engage in process modelling.","Software","Yes","2014","ERSEM is the ecosystem model component of the UKMO run operational forecast system for the NW European shelf.","http://www.shelfseasmodelling.org/index-en","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56cc6a97a663d3.23988147&grantRef=pml010006","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=pml010006","D0E07F50-53BC-4A02-9DD1-53FED044E374","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","EEF9EA95-341D-48C2-8A68-B838D35497C8","7300F58C-5309-42D5-A146-F806C5FA7814"

Our efforts have focussed on adapting the OME Data Model to accommodate EM data and on the development of a customised version of OMERO tailor-made for EMDB. 



* The BioFormats library has now been extended to read several EM formats including MRC, Spider, Imagic, FEI, Gatan Digital Micrograph, JEOL, and IMOD. 

* We have built a full working prototype of EMDB running within the OMERO framework (EMDB-OMERO) and imported the complete holdings of EMDB into this system (http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/snapshots/movies/omero-4-2/mov/Extending-OMERO-EMDB.mov). 

* We have incorporated third-party EM analysis and visualisation packages (EMAN -from Prof. Wah Chiu in Houston, Texas-, Spider, and IMOD) into OMERO, demonstrating the incorporation of EM analysis tools into this project. A demonstration version of our work is available: http://emdb.openmicroscopy.org.uk 

* The same new version of the OpenAstexViewer offered as a web service for EMDB has been integrated into OMERO. 

* The slice viewer offered as a web service for EMDB tomograms uses the OMERO Image Viewer and has been adopted for the specific purpose by PDBe. To support this, Dundee has undertaken significant work to modular-ise the Image Viewer so that it can be used as a stand-alone component. 

With the EMDB-OMERO prototype and the slice viewer, we have demonstrated that we can read EM data into OMERO, edit meta-data using OMERO.editor, archive maps and meta data in OMERO and present data to external users. Crucially, EMDB-OMERO has the functionality to store and present image stacks, and to perform image processing using some of the commonly used packages in the field.","Software","Yes","2011","The software has been incorporated into a production system, the PDBe, running from EBI.","http://openmicroscopy.org","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-6665467905.5004086fd1d3e8&grantRef=BB%2FG022585%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/G022585/1","353C43D4-8D20-4CF2-9393-D587FB98E3EA","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","90051600-6EF2-4093-BA8C-2B4B6F550895","DB183A3A-AC4E-4AC9-9CA8-E0EB9715A00F"

It currently relies on off-the-shelf machine learning, e.g., hierarchical clustering algorithms as the underlying machine learning mechanism, but we are nonetheless at a stage where the advances in the development and our understanding of conformal clustering and conformal predictors (on classification problems) developed within the project can start to be integrated in the frameworks.","Software","","2014","Work in progress",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5464c151101533.86498618&grantRef=EP%2FK033344%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/K033344/1","9BC99088-C040-43AD-87DE-9A38D25C617E","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","7A0397DD-E0C6-4EA3-8031-B841D2503C4D","03C1D4CE-D1FD-420D-9EB4-D0A68CA88FA4"

However, obtaining accurate gene predictions remains challenging. Even the best gene prediction algorithms make substantial errors, leading to further erroneous analysis. Therefore, many predicted genes need to be visually inspected and manually curated, a time consuming process. Here we propose GeneValidator, a tool to identify problematic gene predictions and to guide curation efforts. For each newly predicted protein-coding gene, GeneValidator finds similar sequences in databases of known genes and performs general gene-characteristic comparisons. The resulting report highlights differences between each putative protein-coding gene and similar genes from the database. This allows rapid identification of curation need and guides curators in performing their work. We thus expect GeneValidator to greatly accelerate and enhance the work of biocurators and researchers working with recently sequenced genomes.","Software","Yes","2014","Publication is in prep.","https://github.com/monicadragan/GeneValidator/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54610779eab8c5.93086596&grantRef=BB%2FK004204%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/K004204/1","61C7C135-7053-425B-872C-954E1F146CC3","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","EC4DAE74-15D4-4BE7-A4E3-D418D11CB35B"

Explicitly accounting for an individual's location provides additional information from which to infer animal density. Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods have been developed for this purpose. An advantage of these over traditional capture-recapture methodology is that they allow for animal density estimation using passive detectors (e.g., cameras or microphones) over a single sampling occasion.

AD Model Builder (ADMB) is a statisical software package most widely used for nonlinear modelling, and is well suited to the implementation of maximum likelihood SECR methods. Although growing in popularity since becoming freely available, open-source software in 2008, ADMB is used by a minority of statisticians and ecologists, who, in general, are far more comfortable with the popular programming language and software environment R.

The aim of admbsecr is to enable a user is able to fit SECR models that incorporate additional spatial information, using ADMB to fit the model and return the results to the R session.","https://github.com/b-steve/admbsecr","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5457a44cb51095.48336764&grantRef=EP%2FI000917%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I000917/1","C16FC447-367B-47DF-8F70-8A523BF0DD7E","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","C0E4FAD2-3C8B-410A-B6DF-3B9B9E433060","4C8EAE36-C5ED-4239-B56F-E9535F21C4F4"

The multislice simulation is very time-consuming, which can be a hurdle in cases when one has to deal with a large set of images. In this paper,we introduce a simple computer program, based on kinematic-scattering method, which allows users tosimulate HAADF-STEM images of small nanoparticles, in 'real time' on a standard desktop computer. Bycomparing with the sophisticated multislice simulation, we demonstrate that such an approach is ade-quate for nanoparticles of ~3 nm in diameter (assuming an approximately spherical shape), particularlyaway from strict zone axis conditions. As an application, we show that the efficient kinematic simulationallows quick identification of orientation of nanoparticles.","Software","","2014","The software are available to the public upon request and several requests from american and india have been received and software dispatched.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56df9558d4bdb9.54704435&grantRef=EP%2FG070474%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/G070474/1","0B9D3AE4-1E06-4727-BFDC-8E7F169DE20B","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","8319F78A-DCBD-49F6-BE00-78E1CD75CDA9","247439A9-6D02-442D-8C98-68BB504952CA"

The Ensembl Project produces annotation for many vertebrate species, and has previously taken a major role in annotation for farmed animals including sheep and pig. The improvements that Ensembl has been working on relate to the initial 'genome preparation' phase of our gene annotation pipeline, where the genome assembly information is loaded into an Ensembl relational database framework. The loaded assembly is quality controlled by comparing it to the original assembly files to ensure loading has been successful. Genomic features, such as repeat regions and regions showing evidence of protein coding potential, are then annotated on the loaded assembly. These steps are the precursor to full gene annotation of the target species. As part of this award, the assembly loading and QC phase have been converted to the Ensembl eHive pipeline management system (EEPMS) and been successfully tested. The EEPMS is a pipeline management solution developed and maintained by the Ensembl Project that allows for high levels of pipeline automation, graphical monitoring of pipeline progress and ease of configuration. This will allow the genome preparation
phase of the annotation process to scale to larger number of species than Ensembl is currently able to annotate. We have also converted our feature annotation analyses to the EEPMS and successfully tested it. We have shown that a process that required one to two weeks of work for a
single species can now be set up for multiple species in a matter of minutes, with the whole process running in a fully automated manner over the course of 2-5 days.","Software","Yes","2015","The impact to date has been internal, due to our improvements in the annotation pipeline. However, this work will be very important for the farmed animal community going forward. The next phase of this project will involve building a test suite of modules to ensure that any alterations to the pipeline do not lead to errors in the output. The final phase is to make the pipeline available in the form of an installer or a container for use by the community.","https://github.com/Ensembl","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56d05979ed0af1.92553392&grantRef=BB%2FM01844X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/M01844X/1","219E3590-272C-46D1-9285-A70FACE3B767","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","13D79574-2480-499A-B0E5-6A9132510F15"

This democratisation of access to large-scale data has allowed many research teams to plan to assemble the genomes of non-model organisms. These new genome targets are very different from the traditional, inbred, laboratory reared model organisms. They are often small, and cannot be isolated free of their environment - whether ingested food, the surrounding host organism of parasites, or commensal and symbiotic organisms attached to or within the individuals sampled. Preparation of pure DNA originating from a single species can be technically impossible, but assembly of mixed-organism DNA can be difficult, as most genome assemblers perform poorly when faced with multiple genomes in different stoichiometries. This class of problem is common in metagenomic datasets that deliberately try to capture all the genomes present in an environment, but replicon assembly is not often the goal of such programmes. Here we present an approach to extracting from mixed DNA sequence data subsets that correspond to single species' genomes and thus improving genome assembly. We use both numerical (proportion of GC bases and read coverage) and biological (best-matching sequence in annotated databases) indicators to aid partitioning of draft assembly contigs, and the reads that contribute to those contigs, into distinct bins that can then be subjected to rigorous, optimised assembly. We also present a tool, blobsplorer, that aids exploration and selection of subsets from GC/coverage/taxonomy annotated datasets. Partitioning the data in this way &quot;rescues&quot; poorly assembled genomes, and reveals unexpected symbionts and commensals in eukaryotic genome projects. The TAGC-plot pipeline script is available from http://github.com/blaxterlab/blobology, and the Blobsplorer tool from https://github.com/mojones/blobsplorer.","Software","Yes","2013","Blobsplorer/TAGC plots are now in wide use in genomics.

It has subsequently developed into a general purpose code suitable for a variety of different spectroscopic calculations.

RFM maintenance and development is currently supported by the UK National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO).

The main design features are

 Easy to use - probably its main advantage
 Robustness - you shouldn't be able to crash the program
 Portability - written in (almost) standard FORTRAN-77
 Efficient coding - attempts to maximise speed while minimising memory
 Self-documented code - just in case you need to make you own modifications
 On-line documentation - these web pages
 Output spectra independent of spectral range (eg value at 901.3 cm-1 will be the same whether you produce a spectrum from 901.2-901.4 cm-1 or from 500-1000 cm-1)

Our tracking system is based on two orthogonally placed cameras, connected to a computer via a FireWire connection, and a function generator which was used to generate a pulsed signal set at 25 Hz maintaining a regular frame rate and synchronization. Recording was carried out using the free program VirtualDub. The two dimensional trajectories of the fish in each camera view were determined by manually identifying the fish in each frame using custom written software in Matlab (Mathworks). The two-dimensional trajectories from each camera view were then reconstructed into a three-dimensional trajectory using freely available photogrammetric software. The same technique was used to reconstruct the three-dimensional coordinates of the corners of the tank that contained the maze for an external frame of reference. We intend to make this tracking tool freely available to other researchers.","Software","","2013","Other researchers have approached us for information on our tracking system.

It is an implementation of the univariate Knox test (Knox, 1964), and the Bivariate Knox test (Johnson et al., 2009). It also has simple (but novel) mapping and querying functionality. Principally, it allows the user to analyse crime (or other event data) to detect space-time clustering for a particular type of crime, or (in the bivariate case) across two crime types. That is, it allows the use to test whether a sample of crimes are more likely to occur near to and shortly after a previous event than would be expected, if the timing and location of crimes were unrelated. The data is also mapped against an Open Street Map background. Where crimes occur near to and after another, an arrow between the two indicates which came first.

It was designed to help epidemiologists and public health researchers to rapidly investigate potential environmental hazards, especially those related to industrial sites. The tool uses health, environmental, socio-economic, population and geographic data to calculate risks in relation to sources of exposure and to generate maps.","Webtool/Application","","2016","- This past August, the Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) was successfully demonstrated to funders at the Center for Disease Control. It was later shown to a broader audience of state-level public health monitoring groups in the US at the same event. 
- The meeting in Atlanta provided a means of allowing CDC stake holders to provide feedback on how the RIF would eventually deployed to support their own surveillance activities. They were happy with progress on the project and they outlined some features the tool suite would need for it to be adapted to a US context.
- The RIF is not just one software tool, but a suite of related applications which manage different aspects of supporting disease mapping and risk analysis studies. Among the tools is a highly interactive, graphical tool that epidemiologists could use to specify disease mapping studies. - As well, there is a data loader tool that would allow database administrators a way of cleaning and loading population health data sets and geospatial data sets. 
- The CDC showed particular interest in the data loader tool, which has been designed in a way that may warrant it being used in more generic data loading tasks that are unrelated to its original funded use case.
Both the disease mapping study submission tool and the data loader tool were shown as part of live demonstrations in front of a large audience in the CDC's main conference hall. Among those in attendance were both appreciative users who had used previous versions of the RIF, and supportive people who exhibited a keen interest in having new tools that could save them work doing similar kinds of studies.
- The RIF tool suite continues to garner an widening interest from: Dr. Holowaty, Adjunct Professor from the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto; Frederik Davidsson from the company Geoloc AB in Sweden; Joanne Stares, Public Health Officer at the Public Health Agency of Canada; and public health groups in Belgium.
- The influence of the RIF tool suite may also be felt through efforts that have been made to encourage users to view it as a future community asset rather than just a SAHSU product. To support this end, the RIF team has spent significant effort open sourcing code changes, and publishing design discussions that describe the kinds of informatics challenges it has had to address. 
- The goal of these activities has been to make the development process more transparent to current and future funders, and to eventually provide enough explanation of the tool suite so that its maintenance costs might be able to be spread across prospective collaborators.","http://www.sahsu.org/node/4","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56c340e3bda246.06540982&grantRef=MR%2FL01341X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/L01341X/1","ACB0D5C4-7CA4-4EBA-91FB-948BC9697113","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","D966BB61-3D36-4457-A5A8-2DE10449224D"

In trying to address this challenge, we noted that our lab team actually spend much longer handling information than handling samples. Checking a sample is quick, finding the right place to record and collate the information is more time consuming. This is because each sample has several tests, each checked on multiple days, so the information flow is quite complex.

We were not the first to note this challenge and several companies have developed elegant computerised systems but these are expensive and just as importantly, inflexible. They would require us to fly in an expert programmer from the company every time we change our procedures, which would be inappropriate for a research team like ours.

We are therefore developing and plan to publish an 'open access' data management system for diagnostic laboratories. Although developed for TB, it will likely be valuable for other diseases too.","Software","Yes","2016","We have completed the first phase. All data associated with a sample is now attached on a miniature paper form to the test. This simple, but highly usual step, means that parallel systems for tests and forms are eliminated. For example, 500 TB diagnostic cultures in our incubators are no longer associated with 500 paper forms in folders that have to be found, cross-checked and updated several times each week for 6 weeks. Rather, all data is now attached to the ongoing culture in the incubator, and can be updated in a moment each time the culture is checked. Although this sounds simple, it is highly unusual or unique in TB laboratories and relies upon the second innovation, that these potentially contaminated, potentially infectious forms are then digitally photographers that the digital image is digitised, without exposing administrative staff to any infection risk. These simple innovations have remarkably increased efficiency and increased capacity to provide research diagnostic information for more participants.

The current second phase is developing a flexible, simple, open access 'freeware' tablet computer system for replacing the paper forms. We have obtained independent research funding for this venture ($20,000 USD) and this is in progress with collaborators in NAMRU-6.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56e1888c4a1d93.57673034&grantRef=MR%2FK007467%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/K007467/1","30F73E15-ED67-47BA-9623-CB9F0CBC79E9","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","9FB96E0B-B7E9-4BCD-B01F-FB7008EEE23D"

Differently from state-of-the-art tools, the implemented thermal simulator has the ability to compute adaptively refined solutions in both space and time, which is an advanced feature for such a thermal simulator. These adaptive features add to the efficiency of our simulator since we can compute more accurate temperature profiles with more efficiency (i.e., less computational cost). The existing thermal simulator makes use of state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative solvers for the solution of the linear systems arising in computations. The thermal simulator that we have developed so far allows the user to take the details of the integrated circuit floorplan and produce a fully adaptive, transient thermal analysis. The new thermal simulator makes use of the existing, open source finite element library OOMPH-Lib.

Part of the development of the thermal simulator has required adding new functionality to the OOMPH-Lib finite element library. Specifically, the ability to read in more complicated meshes which represents the geometry and thermal properties of the integrated circuit. The developed software is flexible and lays the foundation for the fully coupled, non-linear thermal simulator, where the thermal properties of the chip are coupled to the power distribution network.

Part of the work has resulted in new ways of generating the computational mesh of the 3-D IC. We are the first research team to introduce an automatic 3-D IC mesh generator by using an in-house framework and GMSH, a well-known open source mesh generation tool. The developed framework supports a hierarchical description of the IC design, which enables designers to simulate thermal profiles at different granularities. MTA uses an XML file for the hierarchical IC description. The reason is because XML is well-suited for storing the data of the hierarchical structure of the IC. We also provide designers with an additional tool to migrate their designs from different simulators to the MTA. Currently, it supports the well-known architecture-level thermal simulator, HotSpot, but will handle other tools in the near future.","Software","","2016","Not available yet.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56defd63cba932.09096435&grantRef=EP%2FM009238%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/M009238/1","95529FE5-948F-4254-BCA5-DA61DDC172A1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","14EF5E01-4DBA-43FB-951B-FB9D39B78973"

FootMILES was a development aimed at eventual deployment to groups of school children, encouraging them to walk to school and during days out with their families. FootMILES tracks walking using a novel Android based mobile app that recognizes landmarks, such as buildings, encountered on walks. Children might in the future photograph the building to earn FootMILES points. The Android image recognition app and server backend were fully developed during this funded subproject and demonstrated with a small group of Year 7 children at the George Abbot school Guildford in a focus group, generating a follow-up report containing feedback on FootMiles.

The software is designed for time domain acoustic and ultrasound simulations in complex and tissue-realistic media. The simulation functions are based on the k-space pseudospectral method and are both fast and easy to use. The toolbox includes: 

(1) An advanced time-domain model of acoustic wave propagation that can account for nonlinearity, acoustic heterogeneities, and power law absorption (1D, 2D, and 3D) 

(2) The ability to model pressure and velocity sources, including photoacoustic sources, and diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound transducers 

(3) The ability to specify arbitrary detection surfaces with directional elements, with options to record acoustic pressure, particle velocity, and acoustic intensity 

(4) An optimised C++ version of the code that maximises computational performance for large simulations 

(5) The option to use the forward model as a flexible time reversal image reconstruction algorithm for photoacoustic tomography with an arbitrary measurement surface 

(6) A fast, one-step, photoacoustic image reconstruction algorithm for data recorded on a linear (2D) or planar (3D) measurement surface 

(7) Optional input parameters to adjust visualisation and performance, including options to generate movies and to run the simulations on a graphics processing unit (GPU) 

(8) An extensive user manual and many simple to follow tutorial examples to illustrate the capabilities of the toolbox","Software","Yes","2012","We have a user base of several thousand, including most of the major photoacoustic imaging groups from around the world. The question-and-answer forum, which we maintain, is constantly active.

Datapoint errors in pedigree genotype datasets are difficult to identify and adversely affect downstream genetic analyses. Errors that are inconsistent with the rules of Mendelian inheritance typically invalidate linkage analysis algorithms, and cause such analyses to fail. Genotype errors may arise from a variety of systematic or sporadic errors in either the genotyping assay, or in recording the pedigree or genotype information.

By applying an inheritance-checking algorithm for markers across the pedigree and visualising the inheritance data in an exploratory user interface, GenotypeChecker allows the sources of data inconsistency can be resolved.","Webtool/Application","","2009","Allowed us to clean data from complex pedigree experiments and thus permit the analysis of data that would otherwise have remained unusable.

DNA reuse in combinatorial library construction is one such idea. Here, we describe an algorithm for planning multistage assembly of DNA libraries with shared intermediates that greedily attempts to maximize DNA reuse, and show both theoretically and empirically that it runs in linear time. We compare solution quality and algorithmic performance to the best results reported for computing DNA assembly graphs, finding that our algorithm achieves solutions of equivalent quality but with dramatically shorter running times and substantially improved scalability. We also show that the related computational problem bounded-depth min-cost string production (BDMSP), which captures DNA library assembly operations with a simplified cost model, is NP-hard and APX-hard by reduction from vertex cover. The algorithm presented here provides solutions of near-minimal stages and thanks to almost instantaneous planning of DNA libraries it can be used as a metric of ?manufacturability? to guide DNA library design. Rapid planning remains applicable even for DNA library sizes vastly exceeding today's biochemical assembly methods, future-proofing our method.","Software","Yes","2014","--","http://www.dnald.org/planner/ACS_sb-2013-00161v_SI.zip","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54637280004af0.09787477&grantRef=EP%2FJ004111%2F2","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/J004111/2","BBCE007B-37B8-4F78-B1D1-B81369870E68","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68","21C6DDE0-BAD0-4BE9-BC4D-6C9C3E5BC98C"

Molecules that are calculated to fit well can therefore be made and tested experimentally, while those calculated to have a poor fit can be ignored, thus saving time and expense. However, these calculations do not always work well. These calculations usually assumes that the atomic charge distribution on the molecule and the enzyme does not change when the molecule approaches the enzyme even when the charges on some of the atoms are quite high and might therefore affect each other, i.e. one molecule might polarize the other. We have developed a method of including enzyme polarization and ligand polarization in docking that can be combined with standard state-of-the art docking software, e.g. Glide. This should greatly reduce one of the main errors in docking. The method is based on a series of Perl scripts and converts an induced dipole to a set of induced charges. The induced dipole can be calculated classically, or quantum mechanically. Typically the induced dpole at the enzyme is calculated from the ligand quantum mechanical electrostatic potential at the atoms of the enzyme.","Software","Yes","2011","Inclusion of polarization by this method typically halves the proportion of compounds incorrectly docked using GLIDE, a state-of the art docking program and therefore has the potential to facilitate the drug design process.

A user would be able to create a topic based on a search term with multiple publishers and subscribers. Publishers in this case represent sources of social networking data. The subscribers perform actions on that data be it displaying the data in the GUI or performing analysis on that data. The system provides a default subscriber that stores and maintains the data whilst providing annotation features in the applications GUI. The GUI is a tabbed layout where each tab represents a topic (search term).
This tool satifies the primary requirement of social scientists working with social media who we interviewed as part of our ongoing research activities for this project. Existing means of capturing social media data are typically licensed and acquiring data through api access is not suitable for social scientists lacking the technical knowledge required to capture social media data. We anticipate that this tool we improve the means by which social scientists (specifically participants we interviewed for this project) are able to collect, link / code/ annotate social media data as part of their research. In addition, due to the extensible nature of the software we have developed, we anticipate that this tool will have further impact by making available more sophisticated and advanced forms of analysis, utilising machine learning techniques such as text classification for sentiment analysis.","Webtool/Application","","2016","None yet known","https://github.com/ptravers/fsc","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56dffe434166a2.03854002&grantRef=ES%2FM001628%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=ES/M001628/1","428D78B2-C208-4DF5-9F4F-CB9AB70F2883","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","F7E13617-2678-475B-99E4-31479C92038D","4D2CD7CB-8731-4355-A0A6-CE0E8021A703"

The original LIFE construction was built with calcium silicate board. This material proved unable to withstand the temperatures of the sizes of fire necessary to achieve under-ventilation. For this reason the original walls were replaced with fire-grade masonry and the new walls were topped with a steel roof (with insulation). 

2. Data suggested that the airflow into the apparatus was being over-measured. Detailed investigation showed that the air movement through the inlet channel did not approximate plug flow. The air inlet channel was redesigned and fitted with new, better performing, instrumentation. The new instrumentation was characterised using a wind tunnel.

3. It proved difficult to achieve under-ventilated combustion in the early version of the apparatus due to extra air reaching the combustion chamber by leaking in through the outlet channel. The outlet channel was reconstructed with a ceramic fibre restriction in order to restrict the counterflow of effluent.

4. It was found that the temperature measurements taken in the enclosure did not describe the combustion conditions adequately. A new thermocouple tree was placed in the interface between the room and corridor. This extra data allows the interface between the upper and lower layers to be understood more definitely.

5. It has been found that the original gas analysers sustain damage when operated under negative pressure.

Interpreting these data is challenging, largely because of inherent variation in signal-to-noise ratio between datasets. We have developed PeaKDEck, a peak calling program that distinguishes signal from noise by randomly sampling read densities and using kernel density estimation to generate a dataset-specific probability distribution of random background signal. PeaKDEck uses this probability distribution to select an appropriate read density threshold for peak calling in each dataset. We benchmark PeaKDEck using published ENCODE DNaseI-seq data and other peak calling programs, and demonstrate superior performance in low signal-to-noise ratio datasets.","Software","Yes","2014","We have had a number of emails from workers around the world who are using the software and have used it ourselves to analyse high throughput sequencing data.","http://www.ccmp.ox.ac.uk/peakdeck","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5453682fa92bc3.38584401&grantRef=G116%2F165","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G116/165","6DF2A95E-D33C-41BA-A692-EF1965565F4D","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","6B2DF52A-FCE9-4C50-B8A5-372AFE1D40DC"

This development enables three-dimensional simulation of large (500 km2) glacial fjords on annual to decadal timescales.

Version 1: Reminiscence Room Prototype

The first prototype presented the user with an avatar placed in a virtual room with objects from the past (old posters, magazines, TVs, books). A radio was also included in the virtual room playing music of that period. Users' movements were captured by Microsoft Kinect and mapped to their virtual avatar.



Version 2: Virtual Tour Prototype

The second version of the prototype was created based on the idea of users being taken along for a virtual tour through a pre-determined path. For instance, The user would tour around the river by doing a &quot;rowing&quot; motion with their arms, which would propel the boat forward along the path. See an example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bflFQOPc9YI



Version 3: Gardening Prototype

In this prototype, the participant would work together with the caregivers to design a virtual garden. 20 objects were available for selection including nine types of flowers, four types of trees and seven types of vegetables. An Android-based tablet computer was used to allow the caregiver/residents to select the vegetation to plant in the virtual garden 



Version 4: Tangible User Interfaces

This version is similar to version 3, but instead of using a tablet, the user would put a plastic flower (tagged with NFC) on a platform in order to plant a flower in the virtual garden. See an example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3jjFjIJJRU","Software","","2013","Testing and revising a number of prototypes also gave insights related to design issues. Each prototype had different benefits for difference group of users and it could not be said that one is better than the other. We are also not advocating replacing physical activities with only virtual activities. Instead, we believe that VW can provide interactive experiences to promote a continuing selfhood which may have been lost due to dementia and/or moving to long-term care facilities. It can also provide stimulation and engagement to promote a feel good factor. Negative memories could be mitigated by playful design. VW could also be a &quot;place&quot; that allows staff and residents to foster personal relationship and trust, which may improve care.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54524a3f96e602.45758538&grantRef=EP%2FJ010766%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/J010766/1","942E28A0-1318-4F42-9CD4-E4BBF8F3F33E","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","C6D0044A-2CD2-4167-B90B-922AF53E361F","B3EADF9E-25FD-4F39-BF7B-FF34BE006974"

This then allows them to be used in optimization problems including satellite retrieval and data assimilation schemes. It uses an operator overloading approach, so very little code modification is required. Differentiation can be performed in forward mode, reverse mode (to compute the adjoint), or the full Jacobian matrix can be computed. Moreover, the novel use of expression templates and several other important optimizations mean that reverse-mode differentiation is 5-9 times faster than the leading libraries that provide equivalent functionality (ADOL-C and CppAD) and less memory is used. In fact, Adept is also typically only around 5-20% slower than an adjoint code you might write by hand, but immeasurably faster in terms of user time; adjoint coding is very time consuming and error-prone.","Software","Yes","2012","The software is available under a free-software license from: http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/clouds/adept/

It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations involved.

Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard format for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.
SEEK is incorporating semantic technology allowing sophisticated queries over the data, yet without getting in the way of your users.","Software","Yes","2009","The SEEK4Science platform was adopted by the all of the ERANet SysMO I and II projects it was designed for and has gone on to be widely adopted in other programmes, notably the German Virtual Liver Network and its followon Liver Systems Medicine project, ERANet's ERASysBio+ projects, and ERASysAPP. 
The Platform is now developed under the FAIRDOM Initiative (funded by the DMMCore project partners, including the BBSRC) http://www.fair-dom.org.

The platform has been adopted by 21 independent projects and groups (e.g. Unicellsys, JenAge, RosAge, SBCancer, Sybacol, SBEpo, SARCHI, VU Amsterdam for Yeast Glycolysis, Systems Science for Health in Birmingham, Magdeburg Centre for Systems Biology). EU Projects that adopt the platform include: EmPowerPutida and Mycosynvac

Combined with the openBIS system (as a result of the DMMCore project) it is the platform for two UK Synthetic Biology Centre's data management (SynBioChem and SynthSys). 

The platform has been adopted by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory a large national scientific user facility (800 scientists, 1500 instruments) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, USA
It has been adopted by the German de.NBI German Bioinformatics Network and the GenoSysFat and DigiSal Norwegian National Projects. 

34 projects are currently registered on FAIRDOMHub Commons, a centralised public community instance of the SEEK4Science Platform. 
Work on the SysMO-DB project and the SEEK directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe, and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area. The SEEK4Science software and associated software, FAIRDOMHub Commons and its support services form a core pillar of the ISBE Light Interim phase. 

Commercially, SEEK was the prototype component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's ElasticAP platform.

Wruck et al. Data management strategies for multinational large-scale systems biology projects. Briefings in Bioinformatics 2012 stated that Out of the box it provides the most useful features for large scale biology projects.

Practical evaluation of SEEK and OpenBIS for biological data management in SynthSys; first report (https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/12236) recommended the platform.

The SysMO-DB project also directly lead to the FAIRDOM project, a consortium of 4 EU funding councils to: Establish a sustainable European Infrastructure to extend the network services to the wider European systems biology community; Develop the necessary toolset and set up a data and model management platform for systems biology project, building on SEEK and openBIS (SystemsX); and document and disseminate the outcomes and activities to funding agencies, projects and centres with the goal of establishing a sustainable business model for this infrastructure.

It uses a physical installation that displays a live news paper, authored by community journalists through an online news production tool. The production tool aggregates related news, BBC programmes using iPlayer and twitter. The physical installation also allows citizen journalists to conduct surveys from the community readers of the live newspaper.

National news coverage of Parliamentary debate is inherently non-local specific content and often communities are affected by these issues and are left without an outlet to discuss these issues. NewsDrop was envisaged as a way in which communities can become more aware of this discussion through supporting local community journalists in aggregating and disseminating local news about Parliamentary debates.","Physical Model/Kit","","2013","The prototype was exhibited at the #NewsHack 2013 event to leading media industry experts which resulted in winning the award for best academic submission.","http://hack.sbl.io","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56d989368892b4.14955207&grantRef=AH%2FJ005150%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=AH/J005150/1","8D6A32E4-3CED-4B0D-A347-3519BD1B3376","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","C8DB7FEF-A19A-4B3A-BCFA-CCD37A2B2445"

A version with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in a Windows environment and the Standard version which uses text based files.","Software","","2009","SHETRAN has been applied worldwide by Newcastle and other research groups including the following:
Case study 1 - Land Use Change and Flood risk
Study of the effect of long-term land use change on flood risk (EA Project SC060092). As part of this work the Dunsop catchment in the forest of Bowland, UK (tributary of the Hodder/ribble) was selected. Preliminary SHETRAN simulations have been carried out for this site.

Case study 2 - Impact of forests on the catchment response for extreme rainfall events
This work is part of the EPIC FORCE project (research.ncl.ac.uk/epicforce/index.htm) focusing on impact of forest management on river basin response for extreme rainfall/snowmelt events. This case study looks at the La Reina (0.35 km2) catchment in Region 10, 41?S, in Chile. This is an intensively monitored research catchment that was forested before the entire basin was logged in January 2001 and then replanted. 

Case study 3 - Wetland Inundation
Three-year study which addressed the issues of water availability for wetland restoration and re-creation. One of the chosen study sites was Ellerton Ings on the River Derwent in Yorkshire.

Case Study 4 - Soil Moisture Profiles

The method utilities the simultaneous acquisition of hundreds of nanoparticles for statistical analysis. The method is simple, rapid, and quantitative. We have demonstrated a sensitivity of s_ext =5nm2 corresponding to the detection of a single gold nanoparticle of 5nm diameter, using only ~1min total acquisition time. From the measurement of s_ext and its dependence on the light polarization, an accurate quantification of particle sizes and asymmetries at the single particle level is rapidly obtained for a statistically-relevant number (&gt;100) of particles. An Extinction Suite Macro for ImageJ was also developed, for quantitative data analysis.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2013","This technique has generated commercial interested with our industrial collaborators BBI Solution, a world leading nanoparticle manufacturer. Precise characterisation of nanoparticle sizes and shapes is key to manufacturing quality control. Current techniques for particle characterisation are dynamics light scattering (DLS), which is easy to use but not very accurate and provides only the effective mean size (hydrodynamic radius), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which is time consuming and expensive. The optical extinction microscopy method developed by us overcomes these limitations and effectively complements these analysis techniques.

* replaced the stage with a sturdy construction with very low inherent noise.

* replaced the optical pathways, decoupling upstream noise via optical fibre delivery and sealing the optical pathway inside small diameter tubing.

* incorporated a white light laser and monochromator to allow illumination with any selected wavelength band of light.

* replaced the QPD with a lower-noise version, and upgrading the software to match.

* incorporated a pathway that allows splitting of the light into four polarisation components before imaging, which provides high resolution information for rod experiments.

*built the system in a quieter room.

The aim of Wolverhampton Civic and Historical Society's project &quot;Looking Up Local Heritage&quot; which was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) of which this output forms a part was to engage with young woman in Wolverhampton by exploring the city and its history through a mobile phone app of Wolverhampton's Blue Plaques and relating this to a web hosted virtual visit to the digitally reconstructed Hospital for Woman (circa 1904-28) in Wolverhampton - also digitally reconstructed by the Digital Building heritage Group at De Montfort University. The Wolverhampton Blue Plaques app lets you explore the city's rich history through its Blue Plaques.

This required the use of a small 2.4mm arthroscope and expertise to accurately enter the digital sheath distal to the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint. The advantages of this new technique is that it is minimally invasive, allows excellent visualisation of the structures in the digital sheath at adequate magnification to undertake surgical procedures, and involves continuous flushing with isotonic saline thereby minimising the risks of infection. As a result this minimally invasive technique of creating a linear defect in the deep digital flexor tendon is associated with negligible pain (no lameness is observed in the sheep afterwards) and creates a lesion that does not heal spontaneously over 6 months, making if ideal to test therapeutic strategies for failed tendon healing in a synovial environment.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2011","This model has been adopted for a subsequent study on implants for intra-synovial tendon repair.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56dcbbed62b7b8.15713785&grantRef=MR%2FJ006815%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/J006815/1","DE747353-E323-41B0-B183-247988744A5D","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","1AB05DA1-4DD6-4843-B416-D7D9441EBFFB","44F15344-D173-48AA-B3F8-49D185D822C5"

The award goes to our coauthor Virginia Smith (UC Berkeley). Other co-authors: M. Jaggi (ETH Zurich), M.I. Jordan (Berkeley), C. Ma (Lehigh), J. Terhorst (UC Berkeley), S. Krishnan (UC Berkeley), T. Hofmann (ETH Zurich).

About the award: &quot;This year, we started a new award program called the MLconf Industry Impact Student Research Award, which is sponsored by Google. This fall, our committee of distinguished ML professionals reviewed several nominations sent in from members of the MLconf community. There were several great researchers that were nominated and the committee arrived at awarding 2 students whose work, they believe, has the potential to disrupt the industry in the future. The two winners that were announced at MLconf SF 2015 are UC Irvine Student, Furong Huang and UC Berkeley Student, Virginia Smith. Below are summaries of their research. We've invited both researchers to present their work at upcoming MLconf events.&quot;

The citation: &quot; Virginia Smith's research focuses on distributed optimization for large-scale machine learning. The main challenge in many large-scale machine learning tasks is to solve an optimization objective involving data that is distributed across multiple machines. In this setting, optimization methods that work well on single machines must be re-designed to leverage parallel computation while reducing communication costs. This requires developing new distributed optimization methods with both competitive practical performance and strong theoretical convergence guarantees. Virginia's work aims to determine policies for distributed computation that meet these requirements, in particular through the development of a novel primal-dual framework, CoCoA, which is written on Spark. The theoretical and practical development of CoCoA is an important step for future data scientists hoping to deploy efficient large-scale machine learning algorithms.&quot;","https://github.com/gingsmith/cocoa","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56dcc9d09fe385.44601434&grantRef=EP%2FK02325X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/K02325X/1","74954CAF-B7F6-4D01-ADF2-3E493BAC12DB","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","5C5826BE-BC45-4895-B4E6-BAB9EAF24571"

Other, earlier technologies and commercial products (Second Life, Habbo Hotel, etc.) were of limited use for research because they did not allow design and data handling freedoms that UNITY offers because the latter was designed for the video games industry.
What allows the current development/use to be significant is the combination of purpose built research environments and the addition of intensive data collection in real time. As well as offering opportunities for the use of traditional data collection instruments my application of UNITY also allows for continuous monitoring of all activity and for the embedding of data extraction devices that are minimally invasive within the participant's ongoing experience. This has to date been a significant stumbling block for research into behaviour, cognition and emotion, which has often had to break the sense of use engagement/experience in order to collect data, or has had to rely of retrospective or post-hoc strategies with questionable validity.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=545b690eee2b37.68550461&grantRef=EP%2FH043047%2F2","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H043047/2","FC78DF94-9EE1-4652-B04A-25560DEDBEC7","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","8A0FC07A-04CD-4F7A-9095-1D2E6C1D918F","76938796-DEAE-49F2-B760-35CFE9CBF0B7"

It has been designed particularly with older people and their carers and families in mind, but can be used by anyone.

You can create pages that combine a photo, text and an audio recording. These can be viewed within the app or printed out. When printed, the audio recording is represented by a beautiful shell illustration. The scan function within the app recognizes the shell on each printed page and, as if by magic, plays back your audio.

As well as printing out PDF pages, the shells can be printed onto other things such as cushions or lap blankets. Music is well known to be therapeutic for dementia sufferers and can be a powerful way to access memories. We have also found that people with dementia often enjoy the feel of tactile fabrics. You can use the app to link a piece of music to a shell. When that shell is printed out (this could be onto a range of materials) you can use the scan function to play back that piece of music. This enables people to create blankets and objects to touch and feel that contain play lists that are meaningful to them.

- A simple design that allows you to make an audio recording, add a photo and a short quote
- A function that allows you to swipe through pages you have created as an e-book within the app and play back your audio on each page
- An export option, which allows you to email a PDF of each page to share with others or print out
- A 'scan' function that, using image recognition, allows you to play back audio recordings from your printed pages by framing the shell illustrations within the viewfinder
- Options to record audio within the app or use tracks from your iTunes library
- Options to take photos through the app or add them from your photo library
- As well as printing out PDF pages, the shells can be printed onto other things such as cushions or lap blankets.
- iTunes file sharing, enabling the user to copy their created book from the iPad to their computer as a backup option. Copied books can also be imported onto another iPad running the Tangible Memories app.
- Handy hints based on our research and experience of working with older people in care homes","Webtool/Application","","2015","The app is already being used in a variety of care homes across Bristol.

This method involves scanning for sequence variations in cDNA-derived PCR amplicons using High resolution melting (HRM) followed by direct Sanger sequencing of only those amplicons which are predicted to carry nucleotide changes. HRM is a simple, cost-effective, rapid and high-throughput assay, which had previously only been widely used in clinical pathology for molecular diagnostic of diseases and patient genotyping. Application of HRM allows significant reduction in the amount of expensive Sanger sequencing required for allele mining in plants. The developed method involves an investigation of total cDNA rather than genomic DNA, thus permitting the analyses of shorter (up to 300-bp) and fewer overlapping amplicons to cover coding sequence of the gene of interest.



This strategy further reduces the allele mining costs. The sensitivity and accuracy of HRM for predicting genotypes carrying a wide range of nucleotide polymorphisms in barley eIF4E approached 100%. These data suggest that this new method could also potentially be applied to the discovery of superior alleles of genes (especially those containing large introns or a large number of introns) controlling other important traits in barley as well in other model and crop plant species. This technique will be particularly useful to laboratories where the funding and equipment set aside for the genotyping of germplasm is relatively modest. It should be readily applicable to any diploid plant species.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","","No actual Impacts realised to date",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-3479220684.13274436fd1aa3a&grantRef=BB%2FE007198%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/E007198/1","5C9A372C-143A-422A-8CCE-29159E92443B","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","ACD5F1CF-266C-4CDE-A399-43DC93429CF9","C50D6694-8CEA-45AC-89BD-53FA2887C353"

Ultimately the user must find the optimised energy usage for a particular scenario (e.g. day, night, winter, summer). The user has the ability to interact with doors, windows, appliances, lights and the boiler thermostat. They also have the ability to &quot;buy&quot; further upgrades to the home that will increase energy saving, such as double glazing, or wall, floor and roof insulation. Whilst understanding the amount of current energy use is important, the virtual apartment also helps explain to the user why there is energy loss by incorporating a virtual thermal camera and visualisations of heat and airflow based on computational fluid dynamics. The user can switch to a virtual thermal imaging mode designed specifically to give a thermal colour gradient representation of the apartment. In addition to interacting with the virtual apartment using a PC or laptop equipped with an appropriate graphics card, users can also experience the environment in a &quot;immersive&quot; style of engagement, as the software has been modified further to allow hosting (stereoscopically) on a SmartPhone (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Note 4, S6) using a Samsung GearVR head-mounted display and interactive controller.","Software","","2015","The concept demonstrator was presented as part of the 2014 BEHAVE conference in Oxford and formed a central part of end user evaluation trials being conducted in collaboration with University of Plymouth collaborators.

It can be used to build musical instruments, including the D-Box hackable musical instrument developed for the EPSRC Hackable Instruments project. The software is of particular interest to audio and music researchers, especially those building real-time systems.

With less than 1ms of latency between action and sound, Bela performs faster than any other computer-based environment on the market, including high-spec laptops. It also features audio-rate sampling of every analog and digital input which makes design of sensor systems convenient. In 2015, a built-in browser-based IDE was added along with support for the Pure Data graphical computer music language widely used in the digital music community.","Software","Yes","2014","Bela has gained significant traction amongst researchers, musicians and hobbyists in the 2014-16 period. 

On 29 February 2016, we launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for Bela, seeking &pound;5k to build and distribute the hardware. We exceeded our funding goal in less than 4 hours (out of a 32-day campaign) and as of one week later, we have raised more than &pound;31k with over three weeks remaining. So far there are 320 backers of the campaign, and we have received invitations to collaborate from major academic institutions (IRCAM in France, STEIM in the Netherlands) and industry (ROLI, who are interested in supporting their JUCE environment).

Meanwhile, since 2014 we have held 10+ workshops on Bela and/or the D-Box instrument including 2 workshops at the Sonar music festival, a workshop at the NIME 2015 conference (Baton Rouge, LA, USA), an Audio Music Hackathon sponsored by Harman Audio, and an Accessible Music Hackathon with the charity Drake Music (held at QMUL).

absolute binding free energy calculations. This included new algorithms for automatically generating z-matrices
of molecules, automatically loading the molecular structure and parameters from Amber format topology/coordinate

Mutation Reduces Drug Binding Affinity&quot; Scientific Reports, doi:10.1038/srep03561 The emergence of a novel H7N9 avian influenza that infects humans is a serious cause for concern. Of the genome sequences of H7N9 neuraminidase available, one contains a substitution of arginine to lysine at position 292, suggesting a potential for reduced drug binding efficacy. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir bound to H7N9, H7N9-R292K, and a structurally related H11N9 neuraminidase. They show that H7N9 neuraminidase is structurally homologous to H11N9, binding the drugs in identical modes. The simulations reveal that the R292K mutation disrupts drug binding in H7N9 in a comparable manner to that observed experimentally for H11N9-R292K. Absolute binding free energy calculations with the WaterSwap method confirm a reduction in binding affinity. This indicates that the efficacy of antiviral drugs against H7N9-R292K will be reduced. Simulations can assist in predicting disruption of binding caused by mutations in neuraminidase, thereby providing a computational 'assay.'","http://www.siremol.org/Sire/Home.html","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54628a33864701.57650874&grantRef=EP%2FI030395%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I030395/1","65C6B351-4696-4C62-9485-AC6D9F7BF2EE","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","2A2990B1-E1E1-4888-8848-7C256C3A3B43"

We used the remaining radiation from the Ti:Sapphire laser to provide the depletion beam, which we diffracted off a computer generated hologram on a spatial light modulator (SLM) to produce the desired &quot;doughnut beam&quot; profile. This provided a (relatively) low cost route to tunable excitation and depletion beams for STED microscopy. We also exploited our ability to control the spatial beam profile using the SLM to precompensate for optical aberrations in the microscope - and later in the sample. In addition we implemented time-correlated single photon counting detection (TCSPC) to provide fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). We also used this time-resolution to select the later arriving photons since we discovered that the earliest arriving light did not contribute to the super-resovled STED image.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2010","This project produced the first demonstration of a STED microscope based on a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser pumping a supercontinuum for excitation and depleting with the Ti:Sapphire laser beam. It was also the first demonstration of STED FLIM, the first report of the variation in spatial resolution according to how the detected signal was analysed temporally and the first demonstration of the use of an SLM to compensate for aberrations in the system.

It is accessible at www.lppp.lancs.ac.uk. The Lancaster Particle Physics Package allows users to control simulated particle collisions and to carry out various experiments. The pre-existing LPPP modules are: 
1) Pool: kinematics of particle collisions. 
2) Annihilation: physics behind electron-positron annihilation. 
3) Magnetic field: movement of charged particles in the magnetic field, and its use for momentum measurements.
4) Lifetime: mass and lifetime measurements for neutral kaons produced in simulated collisions.
5) Higgs: search for the Higgs boson in the gamma-gamma decay mode at the LHC.
6) Neutrino mixing: simulation of high energy muon neutrinos colliding with a target with and without oscillating into an electron neutrino.

Now that the Higgs boson has been found, new modules have been developed for the LPPP that focus on the continuing story of particle physics: describing theory of the symmetry breaking potential, the Higgs self coupling (shape of the symmetry breaking potential) and measuring branching ratios of Higgs decay modes. The setup is a simplified version of an LHC-like experiments, adapted as needed to re-use concepts and methods introduced in previous modules and to reduce unnecessary complications. A simulation of an experiment which allow the user to observe images of four different event types has been added: i) H -&gt; b bbar, ii) H -&gt; tau+ tau-, iii) H -&gt; ZZ -&gt; 4l and iv) H -&gt; gamma - gamma.
Armed with the skills and techniques learnt in other modules (measurement of track momentum, measurement of electron/photon energy in a calorimeter) and in the previous page, the user is able to classify each (randomly produced) event into one of the five classes shown above and keep track of the event numbers in each of the categories. With enough statistics branching ratios (and their uncertainties!) will be calculated. 

The development version with the new modules can be found here: 
http://lapb.lancs.ac.uk/internal/package/pb/","Webtool/Application","","2016","The module, together with other parts of the LPPP, are being used during Particle Physics Masterclasses in Lancaster and other UK universities. Over the years more than 10000 A-level students in the UK have been introduced to particle physics using this tool. In addition to outreach activities at universities and research centres teachers are using the LPPP as a resource in their classes at school. Students are inspired to study STEM subjects such as Physics, Engineering and Computing in this way.
The new version of the package will again be included to the European Masterclass resources and reach Europe wide distribution. This distribution reaches several thousands of students each year in addition to schools and teachers Europe wide.","http://lppp.lancs.ac.uk/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56deaf28822945.84772054&grantRef=ST%2FL005476%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=ST/L005476/1","F700E343-FCDD-4AE5-90B6-9ECBFDC220AB","D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","DD463C9D-0309-44CA-B70C-94DD66A6C3D0"

Currently all pages related to the study/experimental data, metadata and primary research files (MetaboLights repository) as well as compound pages (MetaboLights Reference Layer) as served by this web service. For public data the WS allows open access, but for private data the user needs to be authenticated and authorised, which is all handled in the WS.","Webtool/Application","","2015","We have moved the underlaying technology stack into a more modular modern design. When MetaboLights was first built, we successfully based the repository on the existing ISA data model. Our experience has been that this was in great need of modernisation and was rather cumbersome to maintain. 
To enable online edit of the primary metadata files, we also needed to have a system less dependent on the database model and more focused on the main ISA-Tab files. Our current WS reads all the data, but we are still implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) features.

It supports both Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) and Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations for a wide range of phenomena. It is supplied with its own Java-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) and is capable of both serial and parallel execution. Version 2.6 was released in November 2015.","Software","Yes","2015","DL_MESO is UKCOMES's flagship open-source software for worldwide distribution: a general purpose, highly scalable mesoscale simulation package for both Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) methods [1]. It is written in C++ for LBM and Fortran90 for DPD. It is supplied with its own Java-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) and is capable of both serial and parallel execution using MPI and/or OpenMP. 

DL_MESO was initially developed for the UK's collaborative computational project for simulation of condensed phases (CCP5) during 2003-06. It was subsequently made available to the global community through open access. In a rapidly developing field like mesoscale modelling, the relevance and importance of DL_MESO depend on its continued upgrading in modelling capabilities and computational efficiency on new computing architectures. UKCOMES activities contribute to DL_MESO in three main aspects: (1) incorporation of the latest physical models; (2) assessment and validation of physical models and numerical methods in DL_MESO; (3) adaptation to new software and hardware environments. Briefly, work by UKCOMES is to ensure the accuracy, robustness and reliability of DL_MESO so that it stays at the cutting edge of mesoscale simulation. 

DL_MESO has a global user base. More than 1,100 academic licences for DL_MESO have been granted since its first release in 2004. The current version of DL_MESO (2.6) was released in November 2015 and has 59 users to date. The previous release (version 2.5) had 410 registered users from academia and industry: among them, about 20% were based in the UK, 24% mainland Europe, 19% China, 10% North America and 27% in the rest of the world. Dividing these users among their subject groups, 37% are identified as engineers, 21% physicists, 20% chemists, 12% material scientists and smaller numbers of computer scientists, earth scientists, bioscientists and mathematicians. Examples of applications include catalytic reactive flows [2], water diffusion in proton exchange membrane fuel cells [3] and proton dissociation and transfer using DPD [4].

DL_MESO is being used extensively in a TSB-funded industrial consortium (Unilever, Syngenta, Infineum and STFC's Hartree Centre) for Computer Aided Formulation of new products, using DPD as a heuristic tool for mesoscopic phase prediction to select potential product formulations for laboratory experimentation. 

Current work includes incorporation of various new physical models such as cascaded LBM for multiphase flow [5], a new approach to contact angle hysteresis [6] and kinetic and slip boundary conditions. Co-development with the consortium's other two open-source codes - LB3D and HemeLB - is being considered. Finally, incorporation of GPU and other computing techniques is being explored for new computing architectures, such as Intel Xeon Phi many-core accelerators [7].

It has been ported to many supercomputers worldwide, where it has shown excellent scalability. Most recently it has been shown to scale linearly on up to 294,000 cores on the European Blue Gene/P system Jugene. LB3D is developed by the Centre for Computational Chemistry at University College London, University of Stuttgart, and the Technical University of Eindhoven.

These developments have enabled us to reveal interesting phenomena in charged rocks, namely a non-monotonic dispersion coefficient and a crossover in the effective diffusion of charged tracers. The publication of these novel scientific insights is currently under preparation [Schiller and Coveney]. This research has benefitted considerably from the generous allocation of computing time on ARCHER through UKCOMES. Dr. Schiller will continue to develop and use LB3D at Clemson University, USA, thus broadening the international scientific impact of LB3D.

This extended operational lifetime is made possible by the use of software protocols on-board the tags that manage sensors, data collection, storage, compression and transmission to ensure that the most useful data are sent at appropriate resolution while minimizing redundancy.","Software","","2015","While tag software is tailored to the particular species under study and the questions being addressed with a given field deployment, the philosophy behind Sea Mammal Research Unit Instrumentation Group (SMRU-IG) software protocols is to adopt a general set of principles to achieve the best results within the energy and bandwidth constraints. Here, we discuss these and review the general protocol that is used to simultaneously collect information on geographical movements, diving behaviour and in-situ oceanographic information from marine mammals.This should ahelp other developers to develop ocean platforms of ocean observing.","http://animalbiotelemetry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40317-015-0053-8","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56dd853c652529.79490310&grantRef=NE%2FE018289%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=NE/E018289/1","90E78AEF-C7BD-4269-9F74-D217A0C2CA9B","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","C0E4FAD2-3C8B-410A-B6DF-3B9B9E433060","6B0810F9-E589-4469-9768-5F23BE58B3BB"

To address this problem in the context of complex traits analysis, we present DISSECT. DISSECT is a new and freely available software that is able to exploit the distributed-memory parallel computational architectures of compute clusters, to perform a wide range of genomic and epidemiologic analyses, which currently can only be carried out on reduced sample sizes or under restricted conditions. We demonstrate the usefulness of our new tool by addressing the challenge of predicting phenotypes from genotype data in human populations using mixed-linear model analysis. We analyse simulated traits from 470,000 individuals genotyped for 590,004 SNPs in ~4 h using the combined computational power of 8,400 processor cores. We find that prediction accuracies in excess of 80% of the theoretical maximum could be achieved with large sample sizes.","Software","Yes","2015","It is too soon to know the impact of DISSECT.

The basic DL work on UKRMol-in was to support this best-practice technical upgrade carried out at OU and UCL. Nb: R-matrix theory separates configuration space into two regions divided by a sphere. While the full mathematical solution of the Schrodinger equation is not affected by this division, computationally the inner and outer region codes are distinct and rely on separate methods with distinct opportunities for efficiency, parallelization, optimization etc.
The CCPForge site was established at the start of UK-RAMP and has grown significantly since.
Nb2: The user-release software is open source after (free) registration to the project on CCPForge, the project is moving to GNU public licensing.
From 2015 onwards, CCPQ core support (from DL) has been given in a project to extend the inner region basis sets to incorporate B-splines and use a more explicitly object-oriented approach to allow much more complexity in the target molecule descriptions.","Software","Yes","2009","The main scientific code developments and scientific outputs will be described in the UCL and OU UK-RAMP grant outputs (publications particularly relevant to DL are included in the 'publications' outputs. We note here that the main paper describing the project (Carr et al 2012) has so far been referenced 43 times as of February 2015.
The impacts have mainly been academic (with commercial use of UKRMol through the company Quantemol Ltd: see the UCL UK-RAMP outpus and the UK-RAMP case for support). The upgrading of the codebase is significant for future development of UKRMol (see the OU UK-RAMP outputs). 
One more general impact is that the CCPQ flagship project on Tensor Network Theory (TNT: http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/tntlibrary/) has fully embraced the 'best practice' outlook established for UKRMol and has developed substantially as a result. Other CCPQ projects have also taken on board these ideas.","http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/ukrmol-in/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=545f843e82be00.83653794&grantRef=EP%2FG055475%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/G055475/1","1748B305-8407-46E2-BDE3-C51C34C34127","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","A715CB4E-6888-4FE7-92F3-7C01A22A4C29","9BF3B0A2-A4C6-4BC5-AEFA-C04A1F24D3CF"

The relevance to UK-RAMP is that the inner region PRMAT codes are used as 'starter' codes for the time-dependent (laser-atom) QUB R-matrix codes, in particular the UK-RAMP code RMT (developed as QUB's contribution to UK-RAMP), while a specific UK-RAMP task for DL was to adapt the PRMAT outer region code PFARM to interface to UKRMol. 
The CCPForge site was established at part of a CCPQ core support NAG HECToR dCSE project for optimization of PFARM which predated UK-RAMP: the site has grown significantly since. Further details on inner region PRMAT may be found in the (joint CCPQ-core and UK-RAMP) inner region dCSE report included as a publication, while further PFARM details may be found at https://hpcforge.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/pfarm/index.php/Main_Page .
Nb: R-matrix theory separates configuration space into two regions divided by a sphere. While the full mathematical solution of the Schrodinger equation is not affected by this division, computationally the inner and outer region codes are distinct and rely on separate methods with distinct opportunities for efficiency, parallelization, optimization etc. 
Nb2: The user-release software is open source after (free) registration to the project on CCPForge, the project will be moving to GNU public licensing.","Software","Yes","2009","With respect to UK-RAMP, the UKRMol interface was sucessfully developed and the code has been used to enable massively parallel molecular calculations (already, two specific application papers as of autumn 2014 are included as UK-RAMP publication). The collaboration with CCPQ core support enabled a dCSE project on the PRMAT inner region codes and PRACE 2IP funding for further optimization of PFARM (the latter is considered a CCPQ-core extra funding but the output has relevance for UK-RAMP applications: publications/presentations describing PFARM on novel technology platforms are included in the portfolio, and PFARM has demonstrated efficient performance on a heterogeneous Xeon-Phi platform. The expertise will, post-UK-RAMP be extended to the rest of UKRMol. The PRMAT inner region developments were relevant to a QUB (with DL) ARCHER eCSE project for Tier-0 level optimization of RMT (see separate collaboration entry). As part of further CCPQ core support funded development, a double-continuum version of the inner region codes is being developed over the course of 2015-2016. PFARM is being benchmarked against a separate R-matrix package (PSTGF) for both performance and results. The results agreement is good for calculations in which PSTGF's approximations are considered valid, and performance is competitive although PFARM uses fewer approximations.","http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/prmat-dcse/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5460b456d1e4f3.04547787&grantRef=EP%2FG055475%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/G055475/1","1748B305-8407-46E2-BDE3-C51C34C34127","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","A715CB4E-6888-4FE7-92F3-7C01A22A4C29","9BF3B0A2-A4C6-4BC5-AEFA-C04A1F24D3CF"

For a given protein the system provides a probability distribution over the GO terms, which is consistent with the ontology structure, i.e. the probability of a more general term is always higher than the probability of a more specific one.

Therefore, many predicted genes need to be visually inspected and manually curated, a time consuming process. Here we propose GeneValidator, a tool to identify problematic gene predictions and to guide curation efforts. For each newly predicted protein-coding gene, GeneValidator finds similar sequences in databases of known genes and performs general gene-characteristic comparisons. The resulting report highlights differences between each putative protein-coding gene and similar genes from the database. This allows rapid identification of curation need and guides curators in performing their work.

Longbow handles jobs setup in terms of creating job submission scripts, automatically stages input files, launches and monitors jobs and stages back simulation results. The option is also there to persistently monitor and stage (realtime local syncing with remote simulation files) simulation files at a specified time interval.

This is designed to have the jobs running on the HPC remote resource appear to the user as if the simulation has run on their local computer/cluster. Users do not have to concern themselves with writing submission files, nor do they have to worry about staging. Longbow provides a convenient interface for generating large ensembles of simulation jobs which in effect extends the packages it supports.

Changes:

1. Fix for overwritten rsync-includes (developers only).
2. Bad character length on PBS now has an error message to inform the user what went wrong. Job names longer than 15 chars would be rejected.
3. Jobs that failed in a multi job would bring down the whole lot due to a bad initialisation now fixed.
4. Command line Longbow is submitted with is now logged to the log file for debugging purposes.
5. Bug fix with a bad initialisation in job processing code.
6. New ini parsers that don't rely on python std lib parser, this means comments are no longer deleted.

Changes:

Fix for issue #117 - Python 3 and pip bug: 

1. Longbow would not install under python 3 using either pip or by running the setup script manually. This has now been fixed by using print statements of the format print(&quot;text&quot;), this form will work in all versions of python.

Fix for issue #116 - User reported annoyances: 

1. Fix for user reported annoyance of installing the hosts.conf in secret, and also leaving the archive that is downloaded in $home. This has now been replaced with a warning during install, and also the file is created locally and not downloaded.
2. Removed padding from version numbers so v1.01.005 &gt; v1.1.5
3. Changed the README.md from markdown format to reStructured text, so now the README is README.rst, this is to make Longbow more pip friendly whilst still being bitbucket and possibly github (in case in future we move).
4. setup.py modified to eliminate the python 3 issues, and also the long description is now the README.rst, this means that users will see something standard between the pip page and the bitbucket page, this will also tie in with new pages on the HECBioSim website which will push pip as the preferred way to install more prominently.
5. hosts.conf file has been removed from the development version since this is now created on install for new users using pip, this will be marked as deprecated on the website for a while so users on old versions can still get it. Documentation will need to be updated to reflect this change and provide the quickstart example that users can grab a copy of if they are doing a more manual install. However pip will be the encouraged way to install.

Issue #115 - Parameters in input files:
Parameters specified within the configuration files had to be specified in a very strict format (param = value), users that omitted the spaces would find that Longbow would crash. The code has now been fixed to use regular expression to read in and parse for the equals sign, this can now handle cases where users specify cases such as:
 param1 = value1
 param2 =value2
 param3= value3
 param4=value4

Longbow handles jobs setup in terms of creating job submission scripts, automatically stages input files, launches and monitors jobs and stages back simulation results. The option is also there to persistently monitor and stage (realtime local syncing with remote simulation files) simulation files at a specified time interval.

This is designed to have the jobs running on the HPC remote resource appear to the user as if the simulation has run on their local computer/cluster. Users do not have to concern themselves with writing submission files, nor do they have to worry about staging. Longbow provides a convenient interface for generating large ensembles of simulation jobs which in effect extends the packages it supports.

Changes:

1. Modifications to how Longbow accepts the help and version command line parameters, some people don't follow GNU standards and thus so that we can show them the help message/version we have allowed -v, -version, --version, -h, -help and --help
2. Longbow now creates missing repX directories if they are missing in cases where all input files are global. This would allow jobs that might use different random seeds on the same input files to be efficient on transfers.","Software","Yes","2015","Since the release of the first version of Longbow, there have been just over 400 verified unique downloads between the HECBioSim download repository and the Python PyPi index.

The recent massive increase in capability for sequencing genomes is producing enormous advances in our understanding of biological systems. However, there is a bottleneck in genome annotation - determining the structure of all transcribed genes. Experimental data from MS studies can play a major role in confirming and correcting gene structure - proteogenomics. However, there are some technical and practical challenges to overcome, since proteogenomics requires pipelines comprising a complex set of interconnected modules as well as bespoke routines, for example in protein inference and statistics. We are introducing a complete, open source pipeline for proteogenomics, called ProteoAnnotator, which incorporates a graphical user interface and implements the Proteomics Standards Initiative mzIdentML standard for each analysis stage. All steps are included as standalone modules with the mzIdentML library, allowing other groups to re-use the whole pipeline or constituent parts within other tools. We have developed new modules for pre-processing and combining multiple search databases, for performing peptide-level statistics on mzIdentML files, for scoring grouped protein identifications matched to a given genomic locus to validate that updates to the official gene models are statistically sound, and for mapping end results back onto the genome. ProteoAnnotator is available from http://www.proteoannotator.org/.","Software","Yes","2014","Pipeline for re-annotating genomes with proteomics data.

Given an OWL file, MORe computes the classification hierarchy entailed by the terminological part of the hierarchy.
MORe integrates HermiT (a fully-fledged OWL 2 reasoner) with ELK (a reasoner for the OWL 2 EL profile) and RDFox (a datalog reasoner) in a modular way. In particular, MORe exploits module extraction techniques to identify a subsets of the ontology that can be completely classified using ELK or RDFox.
MORe is designed in such a way that the fully-fledged (and slower) reasoner HermiT performs as few computations as possible, and the bulk of the computation is delegated to the more efficient, profile specific reasoners, ELK and RDFox.

The initial implementation of the tool focused on visualizing PRIDE data by supporting the PRIDE XML format and a direct access to private (password protected) and public experiments in PRIDE. 
The ProteomeXchange (PX) Consortium has been set up to enable a better integration of existing public proteomics repositories, maximizing its benefit to the scientific community through the implementation of standard submission and dissemination pipelines. Within the Consortium, PRIDE is focused on supporting submissions of tandem MS data. The increasing use and popularity of the new PSI (Proteomics Standards Initiative) data standards such as mzIdentML and mzTab, and the diversity of workflows supported by the PX resources, prompted us to design and implement a new suite of algorithms and libraries that would build upon the success of the original PRIDE Inspector and would enable users to visualize and validate PX &quot;complete&quot; submissions. The PRIDE Inspector Toolsuite supports the handling and visualization of different experimental output files, ranging from spectra (mzML, mzXML and the most popular peak lists formats), peptide and protein identification results (mzIdentML, PRIDE XML, mzTab), to quantification data (mzTab, PRIDE XML), using a modular and extensible set of open-source, cross-platform libraries. We believe that the PRIDE Inspector Toolsuite represents a milestone in the visualization and quality assessment of proteomics data. It is freely available at http://github.com/PRIDE-Toolsuite/.","Webtool/Application","","2015","PRIDE Inspector is widely used by PRIDE users as a visualisation and basic analysis tool for proteomics open standard formats.","http://github.com/PRIDE-Toolsuite/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56dd72f30ed173.11433784&grantRef=BB%2FK020145%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/K020145/1","78943DDC-35DF-45FF-B49D-592BFD1C0D27","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","9A22541F-DA58-481E-8D0C-C4BCF4EA030E","2F87710A-0C87-40B8-8F7F-8564C40F18F2"

CIs can enable severely or profoundly deaf people to perceive sounds and understand speech. However, current devices are very poor at conveying pitch information and therefore, although many CI express a desire to hear music again, many are dissatisfied with the way music sounds through their implant.

The IMAP has 24 sessions that link to stand alone applications, which enable users to create and manipulate music. The applications are introduced using written and subtitled video instructions, and each session ends with either a test or directed listening task. Users can also comment on the IMAP in a forum and give feedback.","Webtool/Application","","2014","The IMAP is currently being used by over 130 cochlear implant users, hearing aid users and professionals. The findings from a randomised, crossover trial of the prototype with adult cochlear implant users undertaken in 2012 indicate that the IMAP is beneficial for music perception and in particular, instrument recognition.","http://morefrommusic.org/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5446835ad7be43.49917155&grantRef=AH%2FH039392%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=AH/H039392/1","9D71DDDC-E69F-4EAD-90C6-4B0A72C67419","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","A5D0915A-F70E-46AF-A37C-4C7FB1E46F29"

More about depthmapX and the theories behind it

depthmapX is dedicated to Alasdair Turner.

At the building or small urban scale, depthmapX can be used to assess the visual accessibility in a number of ways. It can produce point isovists, that is, polygons representing the visually accessible area from a location, along with measures of those polygons (such as perimeter, area and so on), or it can further join a dense grid of isovists into a visibility graph of intervisible points (with graphs of up to about 1000000 point locations). The visibility graph may then be analysed directly using graph measures, or used as the core of an agent-based analysis. In the agent-based analysis a number of software agents representing pedestrians are released into the environment. Each software agent is able to access the visual accessibility information for its current location from the visibility graph, and this informs its choice of next destination. The numbers of agents passing through gates can be counted, and compared to actual numbers of pedestrians passing through gates.

At the small to medium urban scale, depthmapX can be used to derive an 'axial map' of a layout. That is, derive a reduced straight-line network of the open space in an environment. The axial map has been the staple of space syntax research for many years, but the mathematical derivation of it is novel. The automatic derivation allows an objective map for research into city form and function. Once the map has been generated, it may be analysed using graph measures, and the measures may be transferred to gate layers in order to compare with indicators of pedestrian or social behaviour. For larger systems where the derivation algorithm becomes cumbersome, pre-drawn axial maps may be imported.

Axial maps may be broken into segment maps, or segment maps, such as road-centre line maps, may be imported directly. These may be analysed using a variety of techniques, such as according to angular separation, road distance, or segment steps. For example, number of shortest angular paths through a segment may be calculated, or the average road distance from each segment to all others may be calculated.","Software","Yes","2012","The software covers two separate models for spatial analysis; the Space Syntax model and the Agent model. These two models are theoretically different in spite of the fact that they agree on the principal relationship between space and society. They start from different representations, and they diverge at the point of modelling. The agent model represents an emergent process that leads to form aggregate patterns of movement activity. Through its ability to display movement data in relation to aggregate patterns of agents, depthmapX's agents have proven to be an effective tool to simulate natural movement. Space Syntax builds on a synchronic reduction of spatial relationships in the built environment. Mapping this reduction into networks of longest and fewest lines, depthmapX's axial and segment analyses are powerful methods for predicting to-movement and through-movement in cities. On the scale of buildings, spatial analysis using depthmapX can reveal relational structures that convey how social organisations occupy spaces. depthmapX is a platform that brings together these too models to be tested in an analytical approach. It also affords experimental and developer approaches.

The current usage of this software has proven to engage different types of academic communities that have a language in common with the notion of space. These communities range between planners, designers, social scientists, anthropologists, crime scientists, geographers, computer scientists and economists. In general terms, all what brings together the social and the spatial. In different contexts, spatial modelling using depthmapX can help forming assumptions about social behaviour in space and model spatial and social relationships. Moreover, depthmapX significance exceeds its common usage as an analytical tool to understand the built environment on different scales and go beyond that to act as a design and decision making support tool. The intelligent usage of software will deploy it in supporting design process with a knowledge-base that is suggested to make designs more responsive towards the real settings of the built environment. In simple terms, depthmapX is increasingly used as a tool for design thinking. By using it efficiently, the software helps on sparing time and cost, particularly on the scale of complex buildings and large scale urban planning.","http://varoudis.github.io/depthmapX/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54575bc366e6c3.29327786&grantRef=EP%2FG02619X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/G02619X/1","79474502-7CDF-48F9-B4E2-5604FA926454","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","123D5014-1D59-460B-91B9-AD274A3D0FB9"

Such large phylogenies are useful for macroevolutionary studies, comparative biology and in conservation and biodiversity. No easy to use and fully integrated software package currently exists to carry out this task. Here, we present a new Python-based software package that uses well defined XML schema to manage both data and metadata. It builds on previous versions by 1) including new processing steps, such as Safe Taxonomic Reduction, 2) using a user-friendly GUI that guides the user to complete at least the minimum information required and includes context-sensitive documentation, and 3) a revised storage format that integrates both tree- and meta-data into a single file. These data can then be manipulated according to a well-defined, but flexible, processing pipeline using either the GUI or a command-line based tool. Processingsteps include standardising names, deleting or replacing taxa, ensuring adequate taxonomic overlap, ensuring data independence, and safe taxonomic reduction. This software has been successfully used to store and process data consisting of over 1000 trees ready for analyses using standard supertree methods. This software makes large supertree creation a much easier task and provides far greater flexibility for further work.","Webtool/Application","","2014","The software is new, but has already been used by 10 final year undergraduates in their projects.","http://supertreetoolkit.org/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54525051e59a69.53227133&grantRef=BB%2FK006754%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/K006754/1","86515EE3-DF65-4B74-8D8F-877115867172","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","EAAD4D43-BD15-432B-9385-2DBD0C65958D","3B9820FD-AF90-40AD-B0DC-FDD25F5F8486"

Flappers are ornithopter-like devices that accurately follow the wing motions of insects while flow visualization and force measurements reveal underlying aerodynamic mechanisms. To create new data, we developed a 'flapper' that accurately mimics the wing motion of insects. It can fly either in water or oil to preserve aerodynamic similarity, has flexible wings and is instrumented with tiny transducers to measure forces. For the first time, we can reproduce the flight of insects even smaller than fruit flies. The aerodynamics of such small insects is guaranteed to be laminar, which is deemed to be essential for validation. In the process of choosing a validation experiment, we showed experimentally that there is turbulent airflow over the wings of large insects and small birds. This invalidates the generally held belief that the functional dividing line between insects and birds is laminar versus turbulent flow.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2012","The flapper enables for the first time to measure the forces generated by insects even smaller than fruit flies.

This software was developed in collaboration with Professor Laurence Anthony, Center for English Language Education in Science and Engineering, School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Japan. There are three main stages to the use of FireAnt:

1) Input: The user selects a file, or multiple files of the same type to upload. These datasets can be in DB/DATA, JSON, CSV, TSV/TXT, and XLS/XLSX formats that are UTF-8 encoded.

2) Filter/refine: Once loaded, the user can then filter the dataset(s) in various ways, such as by date, id, frequency, and column content. This allows the user to refine the dataset whilst being able to see and check the results in real time.

3) Export: Once the user is satisfied with the refined dataset, they can then choose three export options:

(a) The user can simply output the data into DB/DATA, JSON, CSV, TSV/TXT, or XLS/XLSX. For instance, they may choose DB/DATA to create a more refined dataset to work on in FireAnt later. They may choose CSV or XLS/XLSX to create a dataset for manual analysis. Or they may choose TSV/TXT to create a dataset for analysis with corpus software such as AntConc, WordSmith, Wmatrix, and so forth.

(b) Time-series: The user can output an incremental series of times and/or dates with values to plot a timeseries. They may choose XLS/XLSX to undertake this in software such as Excel, or they may choose CSV or TVS/TXT to undertake this in software such as R.

(c) Network graph: The user can output a node-list and an edge-list with which to create a network graph in software such as Gephi or Cytoscape.

FireAnt runs on any computer running Microsoft Windows (it has been tested on Win 98/Me/2000/NT, XP, Vista, Win 7, Win 8) and Macintosh OS X computers (it has been tested up to OS X 10.9 Mavericks). It was developed in Python and Qt using the PyInstaller compiler to generate executables for the different operating systems. At the time of writing, the current version of FireAnt (0.3.0b, released 08th August 2015) is still being tested and prepared for controlled release.

The method utilities the simultaneous acquisition of hundreds of nanoparticles for statistical analysis. The method is simple, rapid, and quantitative. We have demonstrated a sensitivity of s_ext =5nm2 corresponding to the detection of a single gold nanoparticle of 5nm diameter, using only ~1min total acquisition time. From the measurement of s_ext and its dependence on the light polarization, an accurate quantification of particle sizes and asymmetries at the single particle level is rapidly obtained for a statistically-relevant number (&gt;100) of particles. An Extinction Suite Macro for ImageJ was also developed, for quantitative data analysis.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2013","This technique has generated commercial interested with our industrial collaborators BBI Solution, a world leading nanoparticle manufacturer. Precise characterisation of nanoparticle sizes and shapes is key to manufacturing quality control. Current techniques for particle characterisation are dynamics light scattering (DLS), which is easy to use but not very accurate and provides only the effective mean size (hydrodynamic radius), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which is time consuming and expensive. The optical extinction microscopy method developed by us overcomes these limitations and effectively complements these analysis techniques.

The latest version has new functionality for existing workbench tools, and improved user accessibility.","Software","","2015","Since its release in January 2012, researchers from around the world have used the sRNA workbench extensively. Our website has had over 30,000 visits from over 16,000 visitors who have collectively downloaded the workbench more than 9,000 times. To cater for this user base and to maximise impact on the sRNA community, we track workbench usage and employ a variety of social media including, Twitter, RSS delivery of direct comments on the website, and emails to communicate with users.

The sRNA workbench has also been utilised as a resource for various teaching activities. For example, teaching sessions have been designed to bring bioinformatics to biology students, specifically for the teaching of measurement and analysis of miRNAs using next generation sequencing technologies. To date, four sessions have been completed with between 14 and 20 students in attendance at various institutions in the UK (each session being fully booked), yielding excellent feedback. We have also collaborated closely with the bioinformatics team at the BBSRC Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) to develop a public 2-day microRNA workshop that will include tuition on using the tools within the workbench (http://www.tgac.ac.uk/361_Division/training-programme/courses-workshops/tgac-events/microrna-workshop-2016/).

In addition to training sessions, the workbench website contains several downloadable videos and tutorials that show users how to use the individual tools within the sRNA workbench. In this way, we will promote use of the network tool through a medium that has a wide and diverse audience, in order to address the need for bioinformatics tools and training for the next generation of biological researchers. As the sRNA workbench has been specifically designed to be easy to maintain and extend, it is also possible for the future development of new network features to be driven by short-term projects. In particular, PhD projects lead to the development of new tools required by the community that are integrated into workbench. Such projects facilitate training of PhD students in the process of developing and promoting cutting-edge research to a broad user base in the increasingly important area of bioinformatics.","http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56a9ee140ba315.89257833&grantRef=BB%2FL021269%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/L021269/1","DD3CC888-D908-4AFC-92C4-9BD48F6AB16E","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","88C5F7F9-8DCC-41C9-BC4F-F37DA01075C7","641DBDAD-73BF-4D9C-9945-FB0369AF18DF"

We have used the software to measure the performance of DivRep - a database replication protocol developed in the Centre for Software Reliability (CSR) at the City University London. The evaluation is done using TPC-C - an industry standard benchmark from the Transaction Processing Council consortium. 

The software is implemented in the Mobius tool, which is distributed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the USA (https://www.mobius.illinois.edu/). The team at CSR have significantly extended the Mobius model with our own C++ code to implement the model's logic.

NB. The latest version of the software is available from http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/13069/ . Alternatively, please contact Dr Vladimir Stankovic (please see contact details at https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/vladimir-stankovic).

Please note the following regarding the use and licencing of the software:
- The software is available without any warranty.
- No liability for any possible damages applies.
- Although we will welcome the reports of software faults, we do not guarantee any actions as a result to such reports.
- The use of the Mobius tool is necessary for running the software. Anyone wanting to run the software would need a valid Mobius license. The use of the Mobius tool has been traditionally granted free of charge for the academic purposes. Any enquiries about Mobius tool should be directed to the Mobius team at staff@mobius.illinois.edu or mobius-users@crhc.illinois.edu .","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2014","The conceptual model and the software that implements it provide for a new approach in evaluation of database replication protocols. 
The model and the associated software are recent outcomes; we nevertheless envisage that they will be used for the following:
- saving on ICT infrastructure costs and time for measurement. In our own experience, performance measurement takes a lot of time especially if performance needs to be measured under a wide range of conditions (varying workload, load, size of the data processed by the tested system, hardware constraints, etc. Having a model-based approach helps alleviate this.
- evaluating performance variability, i.e. performance is evaluated not as a single number (e.g. throughput), but as a distribution of the measure of interest.

The 'tools' are a set of small programs, together with a viewer that help the user in all the FFEA work-flow, from setting up the input files to visualising and analysing the resulting trajectories.

Besides coding, I have been working on multiple aspects to release the code. The code has been documented, both from the user and from the developer perspectives using Doxygen and Markdown, resulting in a nice web site. In addition, the building and installation processes have been automated using CMake, and the user interface has been simplified.","Software","","2016","The FFEA software is still kept in a private repository.

This assay has been used by various labs to explore gut function and its regulation. We have developed software that offers a flexible environment for a wide range of experimental designs, with special attention to automation and high-throughput processing. This software detects the distinctive changes in acid-base and water balance previously reported to occur in response to dietary challenges and mating. We have used this software to test the contribution of the bacterial environment of the flies to various intestinal parameters including the established diet- and mating-triggered responses. To this end, we have analysed the faecal patterns of flies reared in germ-free conditions, upon re-association with controlled microbiota and subjected to food-borne or systemic, non-lethal bacterial infections. We find that the tested faecal outputs are unchanged in all these conditions, suggesting that the impact of the bacterial environment on the intestinal features highlighted by faecal deposit analysis is minimal.","Software","Yes","2014","This software is currently in use by several labs in different countries","http://the-ultimate-reader-of-dung.sourceforge.net/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=546206699fde24.60411157&grantRef=MC_UP_1102%2F3","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_UP_1102/3","A29E9F7A-30B2-49F8-96F8-A16480673091","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","64BC5E73-972F-41E1-A12C-D97DC9BDFB93","7F59652A-ED5B-4B71-9A38-0CC59AC41934"

These experiments are prone to high levels of unexplained technical noise, creating new challenges regarding normalisation and the separation of technical from biological signal. Unlike previous step-wise approaches, BASiCS is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model that incorporates built-in normalisation and quantifies technical artefacts by borrowing information from spike-in genes that that are artificially introduced to each cell's lysate and thence theoretically present at the same amount in this sample. Current downstream analyses implemented in BASiCS include a probabilistic approach to: (i) identify highly and lowly variable genes within a single-population of cells and (ii) compare gene expression patterns between 2 or more populations of cells. While traditional differential expression tools are limited to detecting changes in overall expression, BASiCS is also able to highlight genes undergoing changes in cell-to-cell heterogeneity but whose overall expression is unchanged. Control experiments and case studies suggests this can lead to novel biological insights that are not captured by previous methods.","Software","Yes","2015","BASiCS is accompanied by two methodological papers: Vallejos, Marioni and Richardson (2015, Plos Comp Bio) and Vallejos, Richardson and Marioni (2016, in revision for Genome Biology). BASiCS has been already used in several case studies including the comparison of gene expression patterns between CD4+ T cells across different related mouse species, during ageing and activation of naive cells (Martinez-Jimenez, Eling et al, 2016, in preparation). Additional high-impact outcomes are expected from a collaboration with Anne Ferguson-Smith lab (University of Cambridge).

It is based on published research I carried out with colleagues at Manchester so I advised MFF and the software developers. The interactive tool combines our spatial and temporal models; a GIS fire risk map shows where risk is highest, and a fire forecast model shows how this changes over time with the weather. Wildfire research and management have developed hand-in-hand in the Peak District - the unique wildfire database maintained by the Peak District Fire Operations Group since 1976 was the starting point for both the mapping and forecasting research. The forecast model is driven by live data from a weather station at Edale's Moorland Centre, where the resource is installed. Visitors can see when and where the risk of moorland fires is highest. It also allows them to explore fire risk history across the moors back as far as 2003. The too; was funded as part of the European Union MoorLIFE project. Following the press release and news item on the KfWf website, I was invited to co-write an article with MFF for Fire Times, a widely-circulated publication for fire professionals.","Software","","2015","Speaking for Moors for the Future Partnership, Debra Wilson said; &quot;This real-time educational tool is the first of its kind in the UK in combining weather and geographical data to give an immediate picture of the relative fire risk across the moors.

It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations involved.

Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard format for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.
SEEK is incorporating semantic technology allowing sophisticated queries over the data, yet without getting in the way of your users.","Software","Yes","2009","The SEEK4Science platform was adopted by the all of the ERANet SysMO I and II projects it was designed for and has gone on to be widely adopted in other programmes, notably the German Virtual Liver Network and its followon Liver Systems Medicine project, ERANet's ERASysBio+ projects, and ERASysAPP. 
The Platform is now developed under the FAIRDOM Initiative (funded by the DMMCore project partners, including the BBSRC) http://www.fair-dom.org.

The platform has been adopted by 21 independent projects and groups (e.g. Unicellsys, JenAge, RosAge, SBCancer, Sybacol, SBEpo, SARCHI, VU Amsterdam for Yeast Glycolysis, Systems Science for Health in Birmingham, Magdeburg Centre for Systems Biology). EU Projects that adopt the platform include: EmPowerPutida and Mycosynvac

Combined with the openBIS system (as a result of the DMMCore project) it is the platform for two UK Synthetic Biology Centre's data management (SynBioChem and SynthSys). 

The platform has been adopted by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory a large national scientific user facility (800 scientists, 1500 instruments) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, USA
It has been adopted by the German de.NBI German Bioinformatics Network and the GenoSysFat and DigiSal Norwegian National Projects. 

34 projects are currently registered on FAIRDOMHub Commons, a centralised public community instance of the SEEK4Science Platform. 
Work on the SysMO-DB project and the SEEK directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe, and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area. The SEEK4Science software and associated software, FAIRDOMHub Commons and its support services form a core pillar of the ISBE Light Interim phase. 

Commercially, SEEK was the prototype component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's ElasticAP platform.

Optogenetics has become a key tool for understanding the function of neural circuits and controlling their behaviour. An array of directly light driven opsins have been genetically isolated from several families of organisms, with a wide range of temporal and spectral properties. In order to characterize, understand and apply these rhodopsins, we developed an integrated suite of open-source, multi-scale computational tools called PyRhO.
The purpose of developing PyRhO is threefold:
1. to characterize new (and existing) rhodopsins by automatically fitting a minimal set of experimental data to three, four or six-state kinetic models,

TeMMPo is particularly useful when a specific lifestyle or dietary exposure is known to associate with a disease outcome, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.

Developed for deployment on the Android platform, the current application allows quick data collection of common behaviour Antecedents, Behaviours and Consequences, as detailed within SimpleSteps Forced Choice ABC charts [Available: http://www.simplestepsautism.com]

The users of the application can indicate the person recording the behaviour and the setting in which it occurs. In the situation where multiple children within a family have autism spectrum disorder, the application allows the caregiver to select the child that exhibited the behaviour being recorded. Users are then requested to highlight from a predefined (clinically validated) list of Antecedents, Behaviours and Consequences, which are displayed as a scrolling list that can be navigated using simple 'swipe' gestures. If an Antecedent, Behaviour or Consequence is not available from the list the user has the ability to access and submit free text entry. After selecting the events from the lists, the Behaviour specific details are selected and include the duration, intensity (scale of 1-5) and frequency of the identified behaviour. As it may not be possible for the user to record the event as and when it occurs, the system allows the retrospective time stamping of collected data.","Webtool/Application","","2013","To date, the developed software has only been evaluated with a small user group of parents. They have used the prototype to maintain a digital record of daily behaviours, exhibited by one or more of their children.

(please refer to 'BMAC_app' section in Software and Technical Products). Consequently, BAs can interpret and action upon a functional analysis of these data in order to implement new / modified interventions. The web portal is linked with a data-mining component (please refer to section on research databases and models), which is used to extract patterns occurring within the recorded data, based on the application of association rule mining to link data attributes.

The data collected is visualised using appropriate charts, graphs and text in order to provide summarised and structured information to users, to assist with highlighting behaviour correlations associated with varying environmental causes and effects. Furthermore, the web portal is also used to support communication between BAs and parents via the BMAC mobile application at home. This can be general information relating to autism, specific guidance about a particular intervention procedure and / or other useful information/ links as well as personalised intervention direction, pertaining to observations made through the web portal. As a result, this component of the system endeavours to augment traditional and on-going face-to-face interactions between BAs, parents and children rather than serve to replace them.","Webtool/Application","","2014","The developed web tool automates many of the manual processes currently employed by parents and Behaviour Analysts (BAs) within a home-based autism intervention setting. Specifically, the tool provides instant visualisation of recorded data through the provision of a user driven user interface that aggregates, summarises and showcases clinically important patterns in behaviour. These visualisation services alone offer significant potential for increasing BA's ability to discover behaviour patterns and to subsequently introduce more timely home-based intervention treatments. 

The visualisation service is further supported via a data mining service that highlights (based on the application of association rule modelling) the 'predicted' causes and effects of particular behaviour by mining previously recorded data from one or more individuals with autism. The service, while requiring further validation through longer user evaluations to generate more data, has the potential to reduce the workload of BAs by supporting them with functional analysis of a child's behaviour.","http://193.61.148.237/~e10426674/BMAC/WP","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=544e21aa640f82.43694435&grantRef=EP%2FK014420%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/K014420/1","5AB5A8A9-A075-4906-915C-BA9333B83FE1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","245EB81A-808F-4697-BAED-263C20266B74","41701417-93C5-41CB-8612-17483EBD0FFA"

We applied this to live cells expressing fluorescent protein labels and showed that its low phototoxicity (compared to standard laser scanning fluorescence microscopes) was compatible with extended imaging over a time course. We also implemented the capability to acquire FLIM data in multiple spectral channels and demonstrated its ability to read out FRET signals from two different cell signalling events in parallel. This is important because disease mechanisms and drugs can impact multiple signalling pathways.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2008","Our technology for high speed FLIM and FRET of cells utilising a Nipkow disc scanner and time-gated FLIM has been copied by several groups for rapid FLIM and FRET, particularly to study live cells. It is also the basis of our automated FLIM high content analysis (HCA) platform that has been applied to assays of cell signalling using FRET, including SUMOylation of FOX1 and screening for binding partners of MST1 amongst the RASSF family. We have also applied this FLIM HCA instrument to assay changes in cellular metabolism using FLIM of NADH. Our work on multiplexed FRET readouts exploiting FLIM has been taken forward by ourselves in subsequent projects and by others.
Many other groups have adopted wide-field optically sectioned FLIM for a range of studies inspired by our work and the manufacturers of the gated optical intensifier used, Kentech Instruments Ltd, and the supercontinuum excitation source, Fianium Ltd, have reported that they believe their sales increased significantly as a result of our work.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56deea414fd897.10677883&grantRef=BB%2FE003621%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/E003621/1","660A1519-976F-45BB-8190-FFCFA657E54B","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","00E7FA36-3E81-4A77-9AFE-2470064E8E22"

This instrument can enable spectrally resolved lifetime measurements via a specially designed fibre-optic probe that is 2.4 mm diameter such that it can pass through the (2.8 mm) biopsy channel of a standard clinical endoscope. It has been engineered to be self-contained on a trolley and is implemented with gain-switched picosecond diode lasers for excitation in the u.v. and blue. FLIM is implemented with time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and spectral discrimination is provided by either a spectrometer or dichroic beam splitters and filters. We have also incorporated a spectrometer to record the diffuse reflectivity spectrum for white light illumination.

This multimodal single-point fibre-optic probe thus provides real-time measurements of tissue properties and, because it bins all the photons detected from a ~mm area of tissue into only a few detection channels, provides high signal to noise ratio with sufficient numbers of detected photons to permit (spectrally-resovled) analysis of complex fluorescence decay profiles, such as are typically encountered with tissue autofluorescence. This instrument has been successfully applied in clinical trials of skin cancer (at Lund University Hospital) and of GI cancer (at Charing Cross Hospital). It is straightforward to use during clinical procedures and will continue to be used in clinical investigations.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2012","The successful trial with this instrument led to further trials with similar instruments being undertaken funded by a new EPSRC project.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-9004826824.1852766fd478d2&grantRef=BB%2FE000495%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/E000495/1","57F02B3B-0707-457E-9EAC-E4D62D2FFD14","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","00E7FA36-3E81-4A77-9AFE-2470064E8E22"

We have previously used a MR compatible in-house built perfusion rig, which employed an RF coil outside the tube enclosing the heart, resulting in a poor filling factor, to non-invasively assess myocardial fiber architecture. We have modified the set up to include the coil inside the perfusion rig closely around the heart thus improving the receiver sensitivity. Changes have also been made to provide oxygen-enriched, albumin-containing buffer at body temperature to the heart placed inside the MR bore. For that purpose, a bubble trap was built into the perfusion head, with active buffer/air discharge allowing rapid turnover of the solution and thus better temperature control. The physiological buffer is first preheated in water-jacketed reservoirs, where it is also bubbled.

Finally, the insertion of a balloon (home made, cling film) in the left ventricular cavity has been made possible, allowing further control on the heart motion.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2012","No actual Impacts realised to date",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-661934409.90702666fd19ebe&grantRef=BB%2FI012117%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/I012117/1","AAA6F516-C48F-4F0C-BD38-FB2F2C1F8832","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","404E3BEC-DB54-4E73-BA03-BF08CC8DDF51"

We have also worked to develop an instrument for STED of GFP-labelled samples, for which we have demonstrated a novel ultrafast fibre laser to be used as the STED depletion laser. This offers advantages in terms of cost compared to current approaches based on Ti:Sapphire lasers and optical parametric amplifiers and provides pulsed depletion, which is an advantage compared to existing c.w. fibre lasers that are often used for STED microscopy.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2015","We intend to implement the new fibre laser in the GFP STED microscope. We choose to target GFP, rather than YFP, which is used in commercial STED microscopes) because we ultimately aim to realise SRM in vivo in mouse or to apply STED ex vivo to transgenic mouse tissue. Currently most mouse models present GFP. We are also working towards a STED microscope optimised for td:TomatoFP, which is also increasingly used in transgenic mice. We have been applying our existing Ti:Sapphire/supercontinuum based STED microscope to the study of STED using nanoparticles that are designed to work with much lower depletion powers - and therefore could be more suitable for imaging live samples.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56ded5ee8f99a5.09796252&grantRef=MR%2FK015834%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/K015834/1","2FF42479-E20F-4E81-BEC1-FED669FDE2A6","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","26439E6D-6C86-4A76-9708-E887FD8DF009"

Structural annotations and 3D model predictions are currently available for three model genomes (Homo sapiens, E. coli and baker's yeast), and the project will extend to other genomes in the near future. As these resources exploit different strategies for predicting structures, the main aim of Genome3D is to enable comparisons between all the resources so that biologists can see where predictions agree and are therefore more trusted. Furthermore, as these methods differ in whether they build their predictions using CATH or SCOP, Genome3D also contains the first official mapping between these two databases.","Webtool/Application","","2013","More reliable proteome structural annotation for use by the community.","http://www.genome3d.eu","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=545d4ce92c4694.97463232&grantRef=BB%2FI025271%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/I025271/1","1D15D8CD-11B5-484C-896C-00271E2FF7A5","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","E5588077-23C0-4F86-AA55-16F178ECD277"

RATIONALE: To address this issue we have developed a framework for the robust analysis of metagenomic data that includes fully automated analysis from next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads to assembly, gene-predicition and taxonomic identification. Furthermore we imple- ment approaches to estimate SNP diversity in metagenomic samples and carry out statistical tests to identify genes where sequence diver- sity exists.
The framework allows easy customisation of any metagenomic workflow, by providing the necessary functions and scripts to manipulate data from NGS pipelines and provides bespoke analyses of the data. MGKit also does not enforce a specific pipeline on the user, but leverages analysis patterns and common files formats (Fig. 1) to make it easier to experiment with different types of analyses.
MGKit is implemented in Python and uses common libraries used in the Python Scientific Community, like NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and pandas, along with packages used in NGS data analysis, like HTSeq and pysam.

The aim of the original project was to investigate technologies that facilitate the retrieval, manipulation and annotation/hotspotting of very high-resolution image datasets (typically greater than 8k x 6k pixels). Each dataset may consist of many hundreds of images, such as those from digitised manuscripts. The Online Froissart Project provided the initial collection of images for the development process; however the viewing environment offers a generic viewing tool for researchers of many kinds and from all sorts of disciplinary fields; it is able to handle arbitrary image collections.

Flexibility in terms of accessing image datasets is given by including the ability to retrieve data from a local hard drive, over the internet, or via a Data Grid using Storage Resource Broker (at the University of Sheffield this primarily makes use of the White Rose Grid and Worldwide Universities Network, WUN). Motivated by the potential bandwidth issues associated with retrieving large images over a network, the effectiveness of encoding the images as JPEG2 was established and successfully implemented within the project. Further benefits and features include:

Entirely written in Java Version 1.2 (includes the JPEG2 decoder and multiple view user interface)

Open source access to the viewing tool

Computer platform independence

Single and multiple views for comparing different images

Virtual Vellum therefore provides an ideal tool for collaborative Access Grid seminars and stand-alone conference presentations and lectures.","Software","Yes","2006","The software is an integral part of the AHRC-funded Online Froissart project website, offering open access to thousands of high-resolution illuminated medieval manuscript folios.

RFM maintenance and development is currently supported by the UK National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO).

The main design features are

 Easy to use - probably its main advantage
 Robustness - you shouldn't be able to crash the program
 Portability - written in (almost) standard FORTRAN-77
 Efficient coding - attempts to maximise speed while minimising memory
 Self-documented code - just in case you need to make you own modifications
 On-line documentation - these web pages
 Output spectra independent of spectral range (eg value at 901.3 cm-1 will be the same whether you produce a spectrum from 901.2-901.4 cm-1 or from 500-1000 cm-1)

It is designed to work on OS X, Windows (currently no digital I/O) or Linux, and interfaces via strobed words (using either a DataPixx [15bit] or a LabJack [11bit]) and ethernet with a Plexon Omniplex for recording neurophysiological data. Behavioural control uses the Eyelink eye tracker and a full behavioural repertoire is available by using a state-machine logic. Opticka uses the ethernet interface to the Eyelink thus affording much better control and reliability over using the analog voltages alone. The various classes can be used without the need to run the GUI and stimuli provide a unified interface (setup, animate, draw, update, reset) to integrate into standard PTB routines. The various object methods take care of all the background geometry and normalization, meaning stimuli are much easier to use than &quot;raw&quot; PTB.

Walking School Buses (WSBs) involve children walking together to school as a group supervised by a coordinator. 

App Features:
- goWSB is an innovative application that exploits real-time information to enable families to track the WSB as it travels along designated stops and reaches the school. 
- You can get a real-time estimate of the WSBs' arrival time at your chosen stop and a visualisation of when it arrives at the school.
- Download the routes provided by your school and choose the route your child will take.
- You can securely add your child to the WSB's register so that the coordinator knows which stop to pick them up at.
- Coordinators can use the application to track their position on the way to school. This runs in the background so they can forget about the phone, put it in their pocket and concentrate on looking after your children.
- You can receive a 2 minute alert when the WSB is about to reach your stop.
- Works anywhere you have a GPS and data connection.

Use goWSB to:
- Better coordinate your morning routine with real-time knowledge of where the WSB is.
- Get ready for a certain time with real-time predictions of when the WSB will get to your stop.
- Let the coordinator know whether your child is getting on the WSB that day.
- Check that your child safely got to school.","Software","Yes","2015","goWSB is holding a National Walking School Bus Competition to coincide with national walk to school week in May 2016.

Charities, like most organisations, are constantly looking at ways of both increasing revenues and reducing costs. 
For charities with a significant high street presence, transportation and logistics is one of their major costs. Donations at shops and banks are occurring 24 x 7, all needing to be collected, sorted and distributed. Lacking the resources of major commercial retailers, and with a significant dependence on volunteers, charities have a unique set of issues around managing the logistics of donation collection and distribution. 

In conjunction with the University of Southampton, Keyfort has developed a cloud based application, FreightVista for Charities, which manages the complete lifecycle from donation through to central collection. It contains three elements:

1) Shop View

A single and easy web page with large and self-explanatory boxes to input the daily donations (clothes sacks, shoe sacks, book sacks etc.). Urgent requests for collection are a click away. 

 2) Transport Manager View

A comprehensive set of functions that allow the scheduling of collections by the vehicle fleets, highly visual views using Google maps to view all the shops, banks and track the drivers in real-time. 

3) Driver App

A smartphone application that enables each driver to hold their daily collection schedule and record collections as they occur. GPS allows the transport managers to see where the drivers are and to re-schedule or re-route if required.","Software","Yes","2015","It is now used in over 75 shops by Oxfam","http://keyfort.co.uk/solutions/software/freightvista","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56c4a1b8995251.25289532&grantRef=EP%2FJ004650%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/J004650/1","58F63EAB-B592-4AE2-8756-15B83C19DB8A","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","2C6E81BC-AAFF-43BE-906C-05E4A1443C96"

One issue with using these data is a lack of knowledge of what data are available, whether it is fit for the purpose of the proposed research, and how to access the data. The WISERD Dataportal has been designed to make answering some of these questions easier by proving access to meta-data on a wide variety of data sets.

As well as providing access to meta-data, where possible the WISERD Data Portal also provides access to existing data through various APIs, such as the NOMIS API.

The system represents the combination of three models, which can, if required, be run separately. It has been designed to assess the combined impact of climate, land use and groundwater abstraction changes on river, drainage and groundwater flows, groundwater levels and, where appropriate, SWI. The approach is interdisciplinary and reflects an integrated water management approach. The system comprises three packages: the Distributed Catchment Scale Model, DiCaSM, MODFLOW and SWI models. In addition to estimating all water balance components, DiCaSM, produces the recharge data that are used as input to the groundwater flow model of the US Geological Survey, MODFLOW. The latter subsequently generates the head distribution and groundwater flows that are used as input to the SWI model. Thus, any changes in land use, rainfall, water management, abstraction, etc. at the surface are first handled by DiCaSM, then by MODFLOW and finally by the SWI. The three models operate at different spatial and temporal scales and a facility (interface utilities between models) to aggregate/disaggregate input/output data to meet a desired spatial and temporal scale was developed allowing smooth and easy communication between the three models. MODFLOW and SWI are in the public domain. DiCaSM, has been developed for unsaturated zone at Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, CEH and equally important, is the interfacing utilities between the three models. DiCaSM simulates a number of hydrological processes: rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, infiltration, soil water movement in the root zone, plant water uptake, crop growth, stream flow and groundwater recharge. Input requirements include distributed data sets of rainfall, climate data, land use, soil types and elevation. The model produces distributed and time series output of all water balance components including potential evapotranspiration, actual evapotranspiration, rainfall interception, infiltration, plant water uptake, transpiration, soil water content, soil moisture (SM) deficit, groundwater recharge rate, stream flow and surface runoff. The first version was released in 2010 ( Ragab and Bromley, 2010) but under the Dry project, it has been subjected to further developments that included: 
1. Adding two options to calculate base flow 
2. Accounting for abstractions, irrigation and discharges from other sources such as treated wastewater
3. Using SQL server instead of Microsoft Access 
4. Adding fast calibration option
6. Adding more figure plotting facility e.g. base flow
7. Adding two extra &quot;Goodness of fit parameters&quot; to the
 classical Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE namely the 
 coefficient of determination, R2 and the NSE based on 
 logarithmic values of the observed and simulated stream flows","Software","","2016","The early version of 2010 has been applied on the Pang catchment in the UK and on other catchments in Cyprus, Italy and Brazil to study the impact of climate change and land use changes on water resources. The studies highlighted the gap between supply and demand in those catchments up to 2050. Also quantified the possible impact of climate change on water resources. Particular interest was given to impact of changing land use to account for more durum wheat areas in Italy, use of Sugar Cane as biofuel in Brazil on water resources. The results were published and communicated by the National Researchers to their authorities in those countries for actions. More details can be found at:

DyverseRBT automatically generates a hybrid automaton - which includes non-dynamical discrete location - and its simulation from a mechanical specification given by the user. The implementation uses S-functions in the Simulink environment of MATLAB.

Unfortunately, the development and application of LFMs can be inhibited by their computational cost, especially when closed-form solutions for the LFM are unavailable, as is the case in many real world problems where these latent forces exhibit periodic behaviour. Given this, we develop a new sparse representation of LFMs which considerably improves their computational efficiency, as well as broadening their applicability, in a principled way, to domains with periodic or near periodic latent forces. Our approach uses a linear basis model to approximate one generative model for each periodic force. We assume that the latent forces are generated from Gaussian process priors and develop a linear basis model which fully expresses these priors. We apply our approach to model the thermal dynamics of domestic buildings and show that it is effective at predicting day-ahead temperatures within the homes. We also apply our approach within queueing theory in which quasi-periodic arrival rates are modelled as latent forces. In both cases, we demonstrate that our approach can be implemented efficiently using state-space methods which encode the linear dynamic systems via LFMs. Further, we show that state estimates obtained using periodic latent force models can reduce the root mean squared error to 17% of that from non-periodic models and 27% of the nearest rival approach which is the resonator model (Sarkka et al., 2012; Hartikainen et al. 2012).","http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v15/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56b9eabca7f091.43165488&grantRef=EP%2FI011587%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I011587/1","E200D524-27CD-4675-B743-4B1DF537E1C6","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","6BFA4E79-9131-41F4-8BB5-0F2969B17516"

Over time, sequence-based classifiers of IDRs have become fairly accurate and currently a major challenge is linking IDRs to their biological roles from the molecular to the systems level. DISOPRED3, which extends its predecessor with new modules to predict IDRs and protein binding sites within them. Based on recent CASP evaluation results, DISOPRED3 can be regarded as state of the art in the identification of IDRs, and our self-assessment shows that it significantly improves over DISOPRED2 because its predictions are more specific across the whole board and more sensitive to IDRs longer than 20 amino acids. Predicted IDRs are annotated as protein binding through a novel SVM-based classifier, which uses profile data and additional se-quence-derived features. Based on benchmarking experiments with full cross-validation, we show that this predictor generates precise assignments of disordered protein binding regions and that it compares well with other publicly available tools.","Software","Yes","2014","None so far.","http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=545f713bb2fcd6.68670393&grantRef=BB%2FJ002925%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/J002925/1","2834AAB3-D5D8-49F9-802C-455AD7DB1A63","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","648AF67D-A9EA-48C9-BB7C-EF285375A5F6"

This reactor system in addition to be used for steam-iron is also finding uses in other related EPSRC projects.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2011","Further research work carried out with materials developed in other grants.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-7230429302.1843116fd203ae&grantRef=EP%2FG063265%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/G063265/1","87503DE0-E597-41ED-9EA3-0C75709B2125","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","2B5B0142-7DF5-4B9D-B623-09A97B710845"

Using statistical approaches, it has shown that a web application can link and analyse different datasets in an accurate, rigorous and user-friendly manner. Bringing together Met Office data on climate variables, daily ozone measurements and ONS Mortality data for London over a 5 year period, the project initially sought to replicate research that linked temperature, air quality, and death rates using time series regression analysis.

The approach was to have user-friendly input screens to guide the user through the process, so they can perform their analysis without the necessary technical skills of some statistical software packages (ie Stata). Having successfully replicated the research, the browser was extended to incorporate additional datasets such as pollen and daily emergency hospital admissions data - demonstrating how the application could be readily adapted to combine datasets from different sources and give users the ability to explore new hypotheses (additional data is available through the full version of the app).

The application is built on open source technologies including PostgreSql database and the Python web framework Django. PostgreSql was used as it has advanced spatial libraries, which would allow for the application to be developed further to include spatial analysis. Python includes a number of statistical packages which we could leverage, as well as being able to run in a web application using Django.

The client is built using Bootstrap and Angularjs to allow for a user-friendly responsive graphical user interface with visualizations such as charts.","Webtool/Application","","2015","It has demonstrated the ability to develop and use a web-browser as an alternative to statistical packages, as a way of linking environmental and health data.

Also shows how different versions of the browser can exist, as a way of restricting access for more confidential data. There are two version of the browser - one is public access, the other requires researchers to apply for access and is controlled through a login process.","https://medmi.data-mashup.org.uk/#/tool/info","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5454a4c1577c98.36152545&grantRef=MR%2FK019341%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/K019341/1","EEA503EE-823A-4830-80ED-6FD54E721181","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","9520F1C3-20BB-40D4-BB1C-64BA14A7BF2D"

Hundreds of sensors can be carried by a single individual to enable installation in one go. These sensors are intelligent. They sense their environment and orientation and are self-calibrating. Previously, sensors often required an engineer to reconfigure the firmware according to the situation, and the data that they produced needed to be treated and transformed before producing meaningful results. Other sensors needed careful alignment and to be placed in a predetermined orientation before the sensor could report back alignment data. Utterberry's sensors are simple to use and operate. They measure multiple parameters at once, a single sensor typically measuring seven or more parameters. This rich data set ensures that all important events are recorded such that not only is data being collected and transmitted, but valuable information is being communicated in real-time to the user so that he or she can make important and cost-effective decisions. Utterberry - making sensing perfect. The UtterBerry, an intelligent wireless sensor system using the world's smallest wireless sensors. The UtterBerry has won the Crossrail Best Practice/Innovation Award for contractors Costain-Skanska who deployed the technology at a partially sealed unit complex at its Eleanor Street site in London.

We exceeded our funding goal in less than 4 hours (out of a 32-day campaign) and as of one week later, we have raised more than &pound;31k with over three weeks remaining. So far there are 320 backers of the campaign, and we have received invitations to collaborate from major academic institutions (IRCAM in France, STEIM in the Netherlands) and industry (ROLI, who are interested in supporting their JUCE environment).

Meanwhile, since 2014 we have held 10+ workshops on Bela and/or the D-Box instrument including 2 workshops at the Sonar music festival, a workshop at the NIME 2015 conference (Baton Rouge, LA, USA), an Audio Music Hackathon sponsored by Harman Audio, and an Accessible Music Hackathon with the charity Drake Music (held at QMUL).

Once a pipeline is running correctly on through the raw scheduler, the app can be registered on the Agave API (http://www.agaveapi.co).

The toolkit has been used to render the human activity evident in archives of geo-coded social media, Wikipedia articles, and Open Street Map exports.

The toolkit is available on Github: https://github.com/tracemedia/geo_qt

This initial version of the software is designed to output large scale map images and geographic animations. It can be used to explore and interact with the datasets, and to configure how the maps are rendered.

The source code is intended to be used as a toolkit rather than as a comprehensive library, and consists of a number of base classes which can be extended to create specific visualisations. The process of creating a visualisation would typically involve developing custom data-processing, rendering, and user interface tools, and creating a configuration file which specifies the map layers, data sources, and styling options.

To utilise an extensive resource of visualisation and GIS libraries, the software has been developed in Python (2.7), and uses the PySide Qt framework for user interface components. Each of the package files includes an executable example which shows how the visualisation and user interface are configured.

The main base classes are as follows:

MapQt: Main Qt map window that contains the map layers. A map is initialised with a canvas size, a projection in Proj4 format, and a geographic extent.

Layer: Abstract Map Layer class. Renders a map layer as an image, and can handle many millions of map features.

MapDialog: User interface for manipulating the visualisation. The map parameters, and the layer styles and properties can be edited via the dialog. The layer styles are in JSON format which allows for complex data-structures.

The visualisations are generated from a composite of map layers, which means that layers can be edited and re-rendered individually. Examples of map layers types include:

GeoJsonLayer: Simple GeoJSON parser and renderer, can be extended for custom styling. This has been used for rendering country boundaries and city level OSM data.

PointDataLayer: Simple point data renderer, can be extended for custom styling.

ThematicPointLayer: Point data renderer that maps data properties to text and point styles. The styles can be specified either globally or per feature.

ModestMapsLayer: ModestMaps layer renders tiles from providers including Open Street Map and Microsoft Bing. This is useful for plotting the data against city level basemaps.

BasemapLayer: Matplotlib Basemap layer, used for rendering country boundaries on a wide variety of map projections that not handled by the GeoJsonLayer. The Matplotlib paths are extracted and rendered to a PySide image layer.

Timeline
Each of the main base classes are overridden to create animated maps. TimelineMap and TimelineDialog include a date range for the complete dataset, and the date range of the current view. The dialog has controls for setting the current date range, playing the animation, and outputting each frame as an image.

TimelineDataLayer displays the map data and can overridden to specify how the features are rendered as a function of the current date range.

 FABM enables complex biogeochemical models to be developed as sets of stand-alone, process-specific modules. These can be combined at runtime to create custom-tailored models. This approach has been adopted to implement several large ecosystem models in FABM, including ERSEM (marine), and AED and PCLake (freshwater). FABM has also been used to model suspended sediment and redox chemistry.

 FABM has been coupled to several hydrodynamic models, including GOTM, GETM, GLM, MOM4 and MOM5. It also comes with a stand-alone box model driver.

 FABM uses modern software standards: it is coded in object-oriented Fortran 2003, has a build system based on CMake, and uses YAML files for configuration.

FABM makes it easy to partition complex biogeochemistry over many building blocks, called &quot;model instances&quot; in FABM.

The new formulation implies an &quot;optimal&quot; level of salinity under which Dunaliella species manage to optimise their growth. When environmental salinity diverges from the optimal level both hyposaline and hypersaline stress are described by the model (by decreasing the photosynthetic rate).

This democratisation of access to large-scale data has allowed many research teams to plan to assemble the genomes of non-model organisms. These new genome targets are very different from the traditional, inbred, laboratory reared model organisms. They are often small, and cannot be isolated free of their environment - whether ingested food, the surrounding host organism of parasites, or commensal and symbiotic organisms attached to or within the individuals sampled. Preparation of pure DNA originating from a single species can be technically impossible, but assembly of mixed-organism DNA can be difficult, as most genome assemblers perform poorly when faced with multiple genomes in different stoichiometries. This class of problem is common in metagenomic datasets that deliberately try to capture all the genomes present in an environment, but replicon assembly is not often the goal of such programmes. Here we present an approach to extracting from mixed DNA sequence data subsets that correspond to single species' genomes and thus improving genome assembly. We use both numerical (proportion of GC bases and read coverage) and biological (best-matching sequence in annotated databases) indicators to aid partitioning of draft assembly contigs, and the reads that contribute to those contigs, into distinct bins that can then be subjected to rigorous, optimised assembly. We also present a tool, blobsplorer, that aids exploration and selection of subsets from GC/coverage/taxonomy annotated datasets. Partitioning the data in this way &quot;rescues&quot; poorly assembled genomes, and reveals unexpected symbionts and commensals in eukaryotic genome projects.

R. Soc. Lond. B). A single locust is placed in a rectangular arena facing a group of conspecifics on one side and observed to record several behavioural parameters. By applying multivariate binary logistic regression, these parameters are used to define a statistical model that yields the probability of being gregarious for an animal of unknown phase state. In the past, the behavioural parameters were obtained using manual event recording software, which is highly laborious and yields observer-dependent results. Some recent studies have therefore employed automated video tracking in closed-source commercial software, which however lacks transparency as to how the behavioural parameters are derived.



To overcome these disadvantages we developed a computerised assay that comprises a modified arena and GNU open-source software components under Linux. The behaviour of the animal in the arena is recorded on digital video using Coriander and ffmpeg software. The position and orientation of the animal is then tracked off-line in SwisTrack.



We developed GNU Octave code to calculate 25 behavioural parameters from the frame-by-frame positional and orientation information. Based on data from about 150 long-term solitarious and 150 long-term gregarious fifth-instar locusts, four behavioural parameters (time spent near stimulus group, fractal dimension, number of jumps, number of long walk bouts) were carefully selected to define the logistic regression model. The model correctly classifies over 90% of locusts with a known rearing history into their respective phases and can be used to objectively predict the unknown phase state of an experimental animal. The assay is completely transparent and can be easily used and modified by others.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2011","Currently used in research projects at the University of Leuven to analyse locust behaviour.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-2673363939.5547696fd1883e&grantRef=BB%2FH002537%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/H002537/1","306F331E-4D1E-4400-B031-9261654CED44","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","D10FC876-6FA2-4F6A-8682-12B2D85E2CF8"

The results show that the total energy can only be determined accurately by combining RHESSI and AIA observations. Simultaneously fitting the proposed representation of the kappa-distribution reduces the electron number density in the analyzed flare by a factor of ~30 and the total flare energy by a factor of ~5 compared with the commonly used fitting of RHESSI spectra.

It performs five common gene expression analysis tasks:

 cross-study normalisation
 feature selection
 sample clustering
 sample classification
 network analysis
 gene set analysis

Unlike other microarray-related servers, ArrayMining is using ensemble and consensus techniques (e.g. ensemble feature selection, ensemble prediction, consensus clustering) and performs automatic parameter selection. For a given analysis task it is possible to combine multiple algorithms and data sets in a semi-automatic fashion. This way new exploratory routes become available, e.g. ensemble sample classification can be performed with predictors obtained from a gene set analysis applied to combined data from multiple studies.

The analysis is further simplified by the integration with annotation databases. This enables further functional analysis and literature mining. The results are presented as interactive sortable tables and three dimensional VRML visualizations.","Webtool/Application","","2009","--","http://www.arraymining.net/R-php-1/ASAP/microarrayinfobiotic.php","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54636393832d30.40924208&grantRef=EP%2FE017215%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/E017215/1","6D645E22-7B34-464B-B644-89B872B1B146","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","936D002F-A8D1-4A93-AE5D-825ED0903D8D","21C6DDE0-BAD0-4BE9-BC4D-6C9C3E5BC98C"

The system is database-driven and facilitates the creation of dynamic user interfaces in response to user inputs. It is being developed in the .Net environment using C#, connecting to a MySQL database, using Sphinx searching technology to index and search the system content. 
The user can interact with the system through direct searching, e.g. key words or document browsing. Relevant documents are extracted by the system and used to generate objects which are then presented to the user through the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The user can refine the GUI by focusing on information that they deem relevant.","Webtool/Application","","2013","The system provides 3 key elements:
1) A timeline which provides instinctive chronological flexibility consisting of multiple arrays of time-scales - days, hours and minutes. The user can expand or contract the timeline allowing the user to manipulate the volume of displayed documents. 
2) A zooming functionality, created by fixing a camera to the 2D x-plane in the 3D environment, facilitates user controlled data convergence. This allows users to zoom in and out of the Z-axis which changes the distance of the camera plane in relation to the displayed objects. The user can control the amount of documents currently on display by the system. Furthermore, it allows the user to focus on clusters of documents that may be of particular interest.
3) The visualisation of information through inter-document relationships. The system database contains a vast range of data which is used by the system to create arrays of objects which have underlying connections. These relationships are used to generate the default GUI. The goal of exploiting the underlying relationships is to allow the user to quickly retrieve information based on whatever knowledge they have relating to the search.","http://youtu.be/PeEbfwKQu30","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56ded1b4b1f890.26545476&grantRef=EP%2FJ020338%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/J020338/1","7A00C580-C561-465C-AF75-7A25B591B444","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5BB4F8BF-B4E0-4EAF-9AF5-885E19D64850","C1B80F63-34A6-47B2-BDB5-0A9D6386B6D5"

ICM+ captures the enormous quantities of physiological data from each patient in an neurointensive care environment form which information about cerebral auto regulation, cerebral compensatory reserve, oxygenation, metabolite production and function can be obtained. Minute to minute decisions about appropriate management can be made based on detection of changing cerebrovacular haemodynaamics. The same software has a major role in tyne management of hydrocephalus and other csf disorders.","Software","","2006","ICM+ (http://www.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk/icmplus), which is by now used in many clinical centres worldwide, attempts to bridge the gap between laboratory and clinical application. It collects data from bedside monitors, calculates in real time 'secondary' parameters defined using highly configurable signal processing formulae and produces continuously updated charts. This way complex information coming off the bedside monitors can be summarized in a concise fashion and presented to medical staff in a simple way that alerts them to the development of various pathological processes.

In this method individual small (&lt;20nm) metallic NPs are visualised with high contrast and photo-stability, free from background and at powers corresponding to negligible photothermal heating, via their coherent nonlinear optical emission called Four-Wave Mixing (FWM) in resonance with the NP surface plasmon. The technique has been implemented to work both in transmission and reflection geometry.

STELLAR generalised and extended the data extraction tools produced by the earlier STAR project to facilitate their adoption by third party data providers. The extracted data is represented in standard RDF formats that allow the datasets to be cross searched and linked by a variety of Semantic Web tools, following a Linked Data approach. The aim is to make it easier for data owners who are not ontology specialists to express their excavation data in terms of the CIDOC CRM ontology (and CRM-EH archaeological extension) and to generate semantic / linked data representations. The STELLAR tools convert archaeological data to RDF in a consistent manner, without requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying ontology. 

The current set of templates corresponds to the general aim of cross searching excavation datasets for inter-site analysis and comparison. Different templates that drew on other areas of the ontology could be designed for other purposes. Each template is a combination of various optional elements with a mandatory ID. The ID is prefixed with a namespace (a tool parameter) to generate URIs. To generate RDF, the user chooses a template for a particular data pattern and supplies the corresponding input from their database. 

In addition to CRM-based templates, there is a template allowing a glossary/thesaurus connected with the dataset to be expressed in SKOS. The CRM templates have elements, giving the (preferred) option of expressing controlled data items as SKOS URIs (either to local vocabularies generated by the SKOS template, or to Linked Data publications of a major SKOS vocabulary). 

The STELLAR templates are available from the Project website, along with the tools that operate over the templates. Documentation and tutorials are also available. The STELLAR tools are open source and freely available from https://github.com/cbinding/stellar","Webtool/Application","","2011","ADS (Archaeological Data Service) employed the STELLAR tools to publish a significant selection of excavation archives as Linked data http://data.archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/.

The second issue relates to the improvement of manufacturing efficiency through in-line error measurement and pin-height adjustment by which net-shapes or near-net-shapes of the formed parts could be achieved. The two years' work has resulted in a low-cost in-line inspection system for industrial uses. The system is developed based on using laser pointers and a CCD camera and by developing new software, and the target is for easy industrial implementation and low system-cost. A prototype system has now been built based on 25 very low cost LED laser pointers and a Sony CCD camera. Early trials are very encouraging suggesting a measurement error well under a millimetre over a relatively large area. Current effort is improving measurement accuracy further. The prototype system developed is matched to the 25 pin-tool being built at Strathclyde and will be tested more fully later in the project.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2015","Potential impacts are on the improvement of manufacturing efficiency through in-line error measurement and pin-height adjustment by which net-shapes or near-net-shapes of the formed parts could be achieved with higher efficiency and lower cost.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56dad2ec3c0827.64384268&grantRef=EP%2FL505237%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/L505237/1","D5BFDD8E-9165-4867-97CA-3D5C2B28DE08","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5BB4F8BF-B4E0-4EAF-9AF5-885E19D64850","6B88EA0C-4D3B-4D54-A67E-FA83B0BB924C"

This allows us to support things like: higher order functions (map, fold), a functional style of programming, recursion, pre-compiled libraries
foreign-function interfaces, run-time services, interfacing with legacy IP cores.

&quot;An efficient method for the calculation of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics free energies&quot; Christopher J. Woods, Frederick R. Manby and Adrian J. Mulholland J. Chem. Phys. 128 014109 (2008) doi:10.1063/1.2805379 The combination of quantum mechanics (QM) with molecular mechanics (MM) offers a route to improved accuracy in the study of biological systems, and there is now significant research effort being spent to develop QM/MM methods that can be applied to the calculation of relative free energies. Currently, the computational expense of the QM part of the calculation means that there is no single method that achieves both efficiency and rigor; either the QM/MM free energy method is rigorous and computationally expensive, or the method introduces efficiency-led assumptions that can lead to errors in the result, or a lack of generality of application. In this paper we demonstrate a combined approach to form a single, efficient, and, in principle, exact QM/MM free energy method. We demonstrate the application of this method by using it to explore the difference in hydration of water and methane. We demonstrate that it is possible to calculate highly converged QM/MM relative free energies at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ/OPLS level within just two days of computation, using commodity processors, and show how the method allows consistent, high-quality sampling of complex solvent configurational change, both when perturbing hydrophilic water into hydrophobic methane, and also when moving from a MM Hamiltonian to a QM/MM Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate the validity and power of this methodology, and raise important questions regarding the compatibility of MM and QM/MM forcefields, and offer a potential route to improved compatibility.","http://www.siremol.org/Sire/Home.html","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54629059ab0b96.44737027&grantRef=EP%2FE022197%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/E022197/1","BB57C680-5AE9-45B7-9B0B-4C5AC773C91A","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","2A2990B1-E1E1-4888-8848-7C256C3A3B43"

Sensors are combined linearly with weights that are chosen to provide optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Signal and noise can be variably defined to match the specific need, e.g. reproducibility over trials, frequency content, or differences between stimulus conditions. The method can be used to remove power line or cardiac interference, enhance stimulus-evoked or stimulus-induced activity, isolate narrow-band cortical activity, and so on. The approach involves decorrelating both the original and filtered data by joint diagonalization of their covariance matrices. In addition to its flexibility and effectiveness, a major appeal of the method is that it is easy to understand.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2010","The algorithms are described in a publication and are freely available online.

DNA reuse in combinatorial library construction is one such idea. Here, we describe an algorithm for planning multistage assembly of DNA libraries with shared intermediates that greedily attempts to maximize DNA reuse, and show both theoretically and empirically that it runs in linear time. We compare solution quality and algorithmic performance to the best results reported for computing DNA assembly graphs, finding that our algorithm achieves solutions of equivalent quality but with dramatically shorter running times and substantially improved scalability. We also show that the related computational problem bounded-depth min-cost string production (BDMSP), which captures DNA library assembly operations with a simplified cost model, is NP-hard and APX-hard by reduction from vertex cover. The algorithm presented here provides solutions of near-minimal stages and thanks to almost instantaneous planning of DNA libraries it can be used as a metric of ?manufacturability? to guide DNA library design.

It helps with the task of setting up job configurations for running jobs using an HPC application. The library provides a means of presenting a visual, interactive tree setting out these parameters in a manner that makes it easier for end users, method developers, computer scientists and computing infrastructure operators to collaborate on efficiently configuring HPC codes to run on different computing platforms.

Templates represent the parameter decision space of an application while profiles provide instantiations of a template with parameters specific to a particular job or task to be accomplished with the target application. Significantly, TemPSS allows the creation of partial profiles - incomplete sets of parameters - and supports collaboration between different entities who can each partially instantiate a profile with the parameters that they understand how to specify optimally. An end-user can then be presented with an almost complete profile that they can finalise to run the target application.","https://github.com/london-escience/tempss","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56cb984eaa0244.23410233&grantRef=EP%2FK038788%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/K038788/1","35A16BFE-40A3-4991-A03D-4305DBF4FE6B","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","78705635-40B1-4C4E-9E7D-9AE59DC55CB1"

DNA reuse in combinatorial library construction is one such idea. Here, we describe an algorithm for planning multistage assembly of DNA libraries with shared intermediates that greedily attempts to maximize DNA reuse, and show both theoretically and empirically that it runs in linear time. We compare solution quality and algorithmic performance to the best results reported for computing DNA assembly graphs, finding that our algorithm achieves solutions of equivalent quality but with dramatically shorter running times and substantially improved scalability. We also show that the related computational problem bounded-depth min-cost string production (BDMSP), which captures DNA library assembly operations with a simplified cost model, is NP-hard and APX-hard by reduction from vertex cover. The algorithm presented here provides solutions of near-minimal stages and thanks to almost instantaneous planning of DNA libraries it can be used as a metric of ?manufacturability? to guide DNA library design. Rapid planning remains applicable even for DNA library sizes vastly exceeding today's biochemical assembly methods, future-proofing our method.","Software","Yes","2014","--","http://www.dnald.org/planner/ACS_sb-2013-00161v_SI.zip","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54637280004af0.09787477&grantRef=EP%2FL001489%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/L001489/1","02493904-BFDA-4ED5-BBDD-599D599528F5","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","936D002F-A8D1-4A93-AE5D-825ED0903D8D","21C6DDE0-BAD0-4BE9-BC4D-6C9C3E5BC98C"

There are two aspects to the CG approach that has been undertaken:

1. A fully featured interface has been introduced between DL_POLY and VOTCA, the latter being the well-known nowadays Versatile Object-oriented Toolkit for Coarse-graining Applications (www.votca.org) introduced in 2009 by the theoretical group Prof. Kurt Kremer [J. Chem. Theor. Comp. 2009, vol. 5(12), p. 3211] and now being further developed at UI-UC, University of Cambridge and LANL.

The key objective of generating synthetic data is to replace sensitive original values with synthetic ones causing minimal distortion of the statistical information contained in the data set. Variables, which can be categorical or continuous, are synthesised one-by-one using sequential modelling. Replacements are generated by drawing from conditional distributions fitted to the original data using parametric or classification and regression trees models. Data are synthesised via the function syn() which can be largely automated, if default settings are used, or with methods defined by the user. Optional parameters can be used to influence the disclosure risk and the analytical quality of the synthesised data.","Software","Yes","2014","The synthpop package for R facilitates greatly generating non-disclosive entirely synthetic versions of sensitive restricted access microdata (e.g. the UK Longitudinal Studies) that can then be made more freely available for explanatory research and training.

Sentiment analysis is very popular and widely used. It involves the search of key patterns recognised to indicate sentiment within a portion of unstructured text. Hardware acceleration of sentiment analysis is of significant benefit, for increasing the number of key pattern and data size within a given time frame. 

Analysing a large number of ?tweets? is a key component of Sentiment Analysis. Hardware accelerated tweet analysis has been chosen as the use-case to demonstrate the research output of the ARIS project. In order to generate a meaningful comparison a full implementation in Java. This software-only implementation ran on the host CPU. The second implementation invoked the hardware accelerators to perform the regular expression matching. A substantial dataset of Twitter content (878,773 tweets) was captured and a test set of 11 company names was selected at random. The software-only implementation performed the task in 463 seconds while the accelerated implementation took approximately 79 seconds in total. However it should be noted that this is almost entirely due to the overhead in loading the dataset from the host file system into memory (78.94s). The actual execution time required on the hardware was only 0.07s, achieving over 6000 X acceleration.Furthermore, the ARIES architecture has been extended towards end users and a sample application has been developed to perform rapid term association. This allows users to load their own dataset for analysis and select a set of seed terms of interest. Moreover the application can be adapted to acquire the test data stream from a network input instead of a static archive if necessary.","Software","","2013",,,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-6322585080.1193956fd52764&grantRef=EP%2FJ020540%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/J020540/1","6D1BE921-12CF-4D9A-93E7-868A72549F82","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","EC23DA53-CA73-4104-A3F6-2A9523484E69","1DE476BF-3DED-4398-BF43-9D403486F32C"

 a modelling language based on P systems which allows modular and parsimonious multi-cellular model development where the outermost compartments can be positioned in 2-dimensional space to facilitate modelling at either extra-, inter- or intracellular levels of detail

 deterministic and stochastic simulator using algorithms optimised for large multi-compartmental systems (the simulator also accept a subset of SBML, allowing for visual model specification using tools such as CellDesigner)

 formal model analysis for the study of temporal and spatial model properties supported the model checkers PRISM and MC2

This type of information is essential for patient follow up in the community, for disease surveillance and identification of hotspots for efficient targeting of limited healthcare resources, for research study participant follow up and mapping, and for identifying populations suitable for enrolment into vaccine clinical trials. ePAL (electronic PArticipant Locator tool) is a tablet-based tool aiming to facilitate accurate identification of place of residence of patients presenting to health centres in Blantyre, Malawi. Points of interest relevant to the community were collected using GPS from across Blantyre city by community engagement through health surveillance assistants. Preceded by an eCRF, these points of interest combined with high resolution satellite maps constitute the ePAL app, which is being placed on tablets in TB registration centres across Blantyre city. ePAL is currently being evaluated in this setting and is hoped will be the first electronic data capture of TB registrations in Malawi and an important tool embraced by the Department of Health and Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome (MLW) research centre for mapping and follow up of TB cases and identification of populations suitable for research including clinical trials.

In this study the median was used as the threshold Td in the sequence conversion, given that the me-dian is robust to outliers [Na02]. A sequence P = s(1), s(2),?, s(n) is created by comparison the original signal with the threshold, with s(i) given by: 
 (1)
Once this coarse-grained sequence has been created from the original signal, P is scanned from left to right and the complexity counter c(n) is increased by one unit every time a new subsequence of consecutive characters is encountered. A detailed description of the complexity algorithm can be found in [Zh01].
The complexity algorithm is dependent on the sequence length. For this reason, c(n) should be normalized. For a sequence of length n and an alphabet of ? symbols, the upper bound of c(n) is given by [LZ76]: 
 (2)
where ?n is a small quantity and ?n ? 0 (n ? ?). In general,
 (3)
Therefore, c(n) can be normalized via b(n): 
 (4)
C(n) is then the normalized LZ complexity. Greater C(n) values correspond to more complexity in the data.","Software","","2013","allowed rhythmicity analysis of epileptiform activity","http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-00846-2_142#page-1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5460bda818e0a4.06728414&grantRef=EP%2FI000992%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I000992/1","8CE5C8FB-0391-46F5-977F-C164ED595C4A","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","67B34D05-3A52-4A09-8FF9-F2398D60E246","4972BA3C-D693-4F9C-B221-6EADE240BEAC"

The basic DL work on UKRMol-out was to support this best-practice technical upgrade carried out at OU and UCL. Specific coding work was to adapt the atomic outer region package PFARM to be compatible with UKRMol-out: this is described in a separate software entry. In addition, the UK-RAMP work and expertise lead to further parallelization work of the UKRMol-out resonance-finding TIMEDEL module, funded by PRACE development effort.
 Nb: R-matrix theory separates configuration space into two regions divided by a sphere. While the full mathematical solution of the Schrodinger equation is not affected by this division, computationally the inner and outer region codes are distinct and rely on separate methods with distinct opportunities for efficiency, parallelization, optimization etc. 
The CCPForge site was established at the start of UK-RAMP and has grown significantly since.
Nb2: The user-release software is open source after (free) registration to the project on CCPForge, the project is moving to GNU public licensing.","Software","Yes","2009","The main scientific code developments and scientific outputs will be described in the UCL and OU UK-RAMP grant outputs (publications particularly relevant to DL are included in the 'publications' outputs. We note here that the main paper describing the project (Carr et al 2012) has so far been referenced 43 times as of February 2016.
The impacts have mainly been academic (with commercial use of UKRMol through the company Quantemol Ltd: see the UCL UK-RAMP outpus and the UK-RAMP case for support). The upgrading of the codebase is significant for future development of UKRMol (see the OU UK-RAMP outputs). 
One more general impact is that the CCPQ flagship project on Tensor Network Theory (TNT: http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/tntlibrary/) has fully embraced the 'best practice' outlook established for UKRMol and has developed substantially as a result. Other CCPQ projects have also taken on board these ideas. 
In addition, the UK-RAMP work and expertise lead to further parallelization work of the UKRMol-out resonance-finding TIMEDEL module, funded by PRACE development effort. A PRACE white paper on this is included in the publications list: further development has greatly extended the parallelism, with much wider applications, and a joint paper on the serial and parallel TIMEDEL module is due to be submitted/published in 2016.","http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/ukrmol-out/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=545fe8638b9559.16961253&grantRef=EP%2FG055475%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/G055475/1","1748B305-8407-46E2-BDE3-C51C34C34127","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","A715CB4E-6888-4FE7-92F3-7C01A22A4C29","9BF3B0A2-A4C6-4BC5-AEFA-C04A1F24D3CF"

It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations involved.

Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard format for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.
SEEK is incorporating semantic technology allowing sophisticated queries over the data, yet without getting in the way of your users.","Software","Yes","2009","The SEEK4Science platform was adopted by the all of the ERANet SysMO I and II projects it was designed for and has gone on to be widely adopted in other programmes, notably the German Virtual Liver Network and its followon Liver Systems Medicine project, ERANet's ERASysBio+ projects, and ERASysAPP. 
The Platform is now developed under the FAIRDOM Initiative (funded by the DMMCore project partners, including the BBSRC) http://www.fair-dom.org.

The platform has been adopted by 21 independent projects and groups (e.g. Unicellsys, JenAge, RosAge, SBCancer, Sybacol, SBEpo, SARCHI, VU Amsterdam for Yeast Glycolysis, Systems Science for Health in Birmingham, Magdeburg Centre for Systems Biology). EU Projects that adopt the platform include: EmPowerPutida and Mycosynvac

Combined with the openBIS system (as a result of the DMMCore project) it is the platform for two UK Synthetic Biology Centre's data management (SynBioChem and SynthSys). 

The platform has been adopted by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory a large national scientific user facility (800 scientists, 1500 instruments) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, USA
It has been adopted by the German de.NBI German Bioinformatics Network and the GenoSysFat and DigiSal Norwegian National Projects. 

34 projects are currently registered on FAIRDOMHub Commons, a centralised public community instance of the SEEK4Science Platform. 
Work on the SysMO-DB project and the SEEK directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe, and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area. The SEEK4Science software and associated software, FAIRDOMHub Commons and its support services form a core pillar of the ISBE Light Interim phase. 

Commercially, SEEK was the prototype component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's ElasticAP platform.

Wruck et al. Data management strategies for multinational large-scale systems biology projects. Briefings in Bioinformatics 2012 stated that Out of the box it provides the most useful features for large scale biology projects.

However, in normal 'uncalibrated' digital photographs the pixel values do not scale linearly with the amount of light measured by the sensor. This means that pixel values cannot be reliably compared between different photos or even regions within the same photo unless the images are calibrated to be linear and have any lighting changes controlled for.
Some scientists are aware of these issues, but lack convenient, user-friendly software to work with calibrated images, while many others continue to measure uncalibrated images. We have developed a toolbox that can calibrate images using many common consumer digital cameras, and for some cameras the images can be converted to &quot;animal vision&quot;, to measure how the scene might look to non-humans. Many animals can see down into the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, such as most insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, some fish and some mammals, so it is important to measure UV when working with these animals. Our toolbox can combine photographs taken through multiple colour filters, for example allowing you to combine normal photographs with UV photographs and convert to animal vision across their whole range of sensitivities.
The toolbox is free, open source and open access and works with the free programme Image J.

Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies have made it possible to generate transcriptome data for novel organisms quickly and cheaply, to the extent that the effort required to annotate and publish a new transcriptome is greater than the effort required to sequence it. Often, following publication, details of the annotation effort are only available in summary form, hindering subsequent exploitation of the data. To promote best-practice in annotation and to ensure that data remain accessible, we have written afterParty, a web application that allows users to assemble, annotate and publish novel transcriptomes using only a web browser.
Results
afterParty is a robust web application that implements best-practice transcriptome assembly, annotation, browsing, searching, and visualization. Users can turn a collection of reads (from Roche 454 chemistry) or assembled contigs (from any sequencing chemistry, including Illumina Solexa RNA-Seq) into a searchable, browsable transcriptome resource and quickly make it publicly available. Contigs are functionally annotated based on similarity to known sequences and protein domains. Once assembled and annotated, transcriptomes derived from multiple species or libraries can be compared and searched. afterParty datasets can either be created using the existing afterParty server, or using local instances that can be easily built using a virtual machine. afterParty includes powerful visualization tools for transcriptome dataset exploration and uses a flexible annotation architecture which will allow additional types of annotation to be added in the future.
Conclusions
afterParty's main use case scenario is one in which a working biologist has generated a large volume of transcribed sequence data and wishes to turn it into a useful resource that has some durability. By reducing the effort, bioinformatics skills, and computational resources needed to annotate and publish a transcriptome, afterParty will facilitate the annotation and sharing of sequence data that would otherwise remain unavailable. A typical metazoan transcriptome containing several tens of thousands of contigs can be annotated in a few minutes of interactive time and a few days of computational time.","Software","Yes","2013","AfterParty now has a community of users worldwide.","http://afterparty.bio.ed.ac.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5460dd8951cf15.16610348&grantRef=NBAF010003","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=NBAF010003","2FF7CFCD-BEFA-4DB8-854B-AD98F4C2E4F7","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","1CE33A3A-C5BC-45B1-A130-BDEB55935C70"

It is able to detect marginal associations (rejecting the null hypothesis of no
association) for each genotype-phenotype pair as well as to identify master regulators, i.e. genetic control points that regulate many phenotypes at the same time. A distinct feature of R2HESS is the ability to analyse high-dimensional phenotypes (gene expression, metabolites, etc) measured over different conditions/tissues/cell types. The software has an R interface that allows users to manipulate and input the data from the widely used R environment.
Besides the statistical association between large data sets, the software performs automatically Bayesian False Discovery Rate calculation, Monte Carlo Markov Chain convergence checks and other diagnosis tests in order to automate user experience. The C++ code is entirely object-oriented and open-source, allowing community-based alteration and improvements.","Software","Yes","2015","R2HESS has been successful used as the key discovery tool in a system genetics approach to uncover the genetic regulations of human temporal lobe epilepsy (doi:10.1038/ncomms7031).","http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/r2hess_1-0-tar/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56d82a8faa4728.50774556&grantRef=MC_UP_0801%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_UP_0801/1","CBF86E56-BCDD-47A5-B366-9CF8CB98CFCB","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","B6161E56-8D19-4789-830F-1528216FD2B6","39DFA6B4-D72F-444C-AA98-5252BB924F6B"

We implement top-down approaches of deriving metabolic states from ~omics data, including our new variant of congruency approach. The software also provides bottom-up methods where regulation is mechanistically modelled. The linear inhibition constraint enables for the first time linear modelling of networks simultaneously describing gene regulation, signalling and metabolism at steady state. An extended version of our Quasi Steady State Petri Net approach allows integration of dynamic models with CBM. This allows user to integrate dynamic models of gene regulatory circuits and cell signalling with CBM of whole-cell metabolism. Microbial community models, where different species compete for nutrients as well as integrated models of bioreactor flows and cellular metabolism can be simulated. The GUI supports editing of metabolic, regulatory and integrated models, display of results and visualisation of metabolic fluxes on network maps with automatic and editable layouts. Stand-alone command line tool is available for integration with bioinformatics pipelines.","Software","Yes","2015","SurreyFBA2 stems from legacy of research on simulation of genome scale molecular interaction networks at the University of Surrey. Previous versions of the software have been used to reconstruct genome scale metabolic networks of bacterial pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Neisseria meningitidis. In biotechnology context, we applied SurreyFBA to simulations of Streptomyces coelicolor - major industrial microorganism for antibiotic production. Currently, we use SurreyFBA to study metabolic reprogramming in non-alcoholic liver disease and cancer. The work on cancer cell metabolism attracted industry contribution through BBSRC CASE PhD fellowships. External users applied SurreyFBA as a computational engine in their metabolomics website and as a research tool. We have also attracted interest of industrial and academic partners of C1Net Network of Industrial Biotechnology and Energy.

At each iteration of the process, the NE tagger is re-trained on all available sentences that have been human anntated, meaning that it makes increasingly accurate predictions about which sentences contain named entities.

We have previously used an in-house built MR compatible perfusion rig to non-invasively assess myocardial fiber architecture. This system employed an RF coil (for MR signal reception) placed outside the container surrounding the heart, providing a poor filling factor and hence poor sensitivity. To overcome this limitation, a reduced diameter volume resonator (internal diameter: 20mm) has been designed to be placed inside the perfusion setting closely around the heart.

Essentially we have demonstrated that we can realise TIRF and STORM using multimode fibres, which greatly relaxes the optical alignment tolerances and the efficiency with which the excitation radiation is coupled to the sample. This enables TIRF and STORM to be realised with much cheaper excitation lasers, including multimode broad-stripe diode lasers. Our simplest &quot;easySTORM&quot; configuration can utilise a &pound;30 laser diode and provide STORM images with sub-50 nm resolution. To make this technique more widely accessible, we have also implemented simpler sample preparation protocols based on Vectashield rather than more complex buffers. We have also written the control and data acquisition software in the open source &micro;Manager software and used open source localisation software (mainly Thunderstorm) for analysis. We have also developed software tools to enable the localisation and the visualisation steps in the data processing to be separated.

The key objective of generating synthetic data is to replace sensitive original values with synthetic ones causing minimal distortion of the statistical information contained in the data set. Variables, which can be categorical or continuous, are synthesised one-by-one using sequential modelling.

The cathode can be abiotic or biotic. For majority of the metals, their reduction is thermodynamically spontaneous. Such metals include Au (III), V (V), Cr (VI), Ag (I), Cu(II), Fe (III), and Hg (II), etc. Their reduction is thermodynamically favorable, and the metals can accept electron without any external voltage application. A small amount of electricity may be generated by recovering metals present in waste streams.

For some other metal recovery, e.g. Ni (II), Pb (II), Cd (II), and Zn (II), etc. an external power supply to force the electrons travel from the anode to the abiotic cathode is required, due to their lower redox potentials than the anode potentials.

For those metals, Au (III), Ag (I), V (V), Cr (VI), Cu(II), Hg (II), and Fe (III) etc. shown respectively from the highest to the lowest market values, for which the redox potential is higher than the anode potential and reduction can be assisted with simultaneous electricity generation, greater than 99% recovery can be obtained except vanadium, for which the recovery is 68% compared to the amount present in the waste stream. The maximum power generated is 6.5 W per m2 for gold; for other metals the maximum power generated is lower than 6.5 W per m2.

Cathodic reduction reactions which include primarily carbon dioxide reuse are shown to produce products, such as formic acid, methane, methanol, pyruvate, acetate, succinate, lactate, citrate, caproate, caprylate, butyrate, etc. are shown alongside their redox potentials. Usually, the product from the cathode is a mixture of many chemicals and can be targeted for biofuel production with desired properties, similar to crude oil refineries. This way, targeted recovery of biofuel is feasible.

Bioelectrochemical oxidation of organic wastes, wastewaters, lignocellulosic wastes and their hydrolysates and stillage streams from biofuel plants as anode substrates using biotic anode harvests electron, releases proton and produces hydrogen, carbon dioxide, pyruvate, formate and fatty acids, which can be reused in cathode for chemical, bioplastic and biofuel productions. Remaining cathode substrates could be wastewaters and lignocellulosic wastes and the cathode reactions are catalytic- electro- hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation and reduction reactions to produce biofuel or bioplastic or chemical as the main products and hydrogen, methane, etc. as the gaseous products. The redox potential for carbon dioxide reduction and reuse in product formation in this way is lower than the anode potential, requiring external voltage or electricity.","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115012678","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56df20346e2229.37153859&grantRef=NE%2FL014246%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=NE/L014246/1","B45DB07A-A707-4005-A8ED-D1F564C28853","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","67B34D05-3A52-4A09-8FF9-F2398D60E246","989E82E7-7E33-4A80-99D4-57158703E3C1"

It operates as a freely available web-based interface to guide decision-making with respect to diffuse microbial pollution risk assessment. Its purpose is to demonstrate variability in spatial and temporal FIO source risks on agricultural land in order to inform more effective land management to reduce diffuse microbial pollution from livestock farming.

ViPER enables user engagement on three levels: 1) as a demonstration farm environment; 2) as a quick FIO calculator; and 3) as a fully functional spatial &amp; temporal FIO risk mapping tool.","Webtool/Application","","2015","The impact from the project will mature over time and will be enhanced with additional modifications of the ViPER toolkit as it develops into a beta stage of release. The impact thus far has been in bringing the different end-user communities together to agree on a structure for a decision-support-tool to inform on diffuse microbial pollution.

The ViPER calculator mode provides a useful tool and allows user defined scenarios, which was welcomed and does provide immediate impact in terms of on-farm advice that can be provided. No participants were aware of a freely-available product that provides information of temporal patterns of E. coli accumulation on pasture as governed by faecal excretion and E. coli die-off.

The most significant impact will arise once the final remaining bugs are fixed, and final modifications implemented, in turn allowing for a wider roll out of the ViPER platform to farm advisors, perhaps most notably the Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Team. They acknowledge that a number of their priority catchments in England have FIO pollution issues and that ViPER could help develop farmer understanding.","http://www.nercviper.co.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56b0ea4abf5368.09737791&grantRef=NE%2FM007812%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=NE/M007812/1","37B75D83-C212-454F-922D-E36A4FEE3527","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","C7510606-A36F-4725-A89B-9D592374972A","2144697F-87D1-40EC-B086-746ADABD3BE4"

We compare solution quality and algorithmic performance to the best results reported for computing DNA assembly graphs, finding that our algorithm achieves solutions of equivalent quality but with dramatically shorter running times and substantially improved scalability. We also show that the related computational problem bounded-depth min-cost string production (BDMSP), which captures DNA library assembly operations with a simplified cost model, is NP-hard and APX-hard by reduction from vertex cover.

TopoGSA is updated twice per year to integrate newly available protein interaction data and reference gene sets. Alternatively, a user-defined networks can be uploaded and analysed. The pathways and processes similar to the uploaded set can be identified based on the 2D and 3D interactive visualisations or using an aggregated similarity measure that combines the topological properties into a single score.","Webtool/Application","","2010","--","http://www.topogsa.org/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=546364ce4892d6.58951269&grantRef=BB%2FF01855X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/F01855X/1","FD558DB9-D915-4E22-88B6-DD6F2351CB6E","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","936D002F-A8D1-4A93-AE5D-825ED0903D8D","21C6DDE0-BAD0-4BE9-BC4D-6C9C3E5BC98C"

The exercises or activities are offered as a structured approach to working on a place-related project or as a set of practices which can be drawn on individually or in combination to address issues of place within the context of workshops, lessons or other similar contexts.

'About Performing Places' offers background through focusing on the theory which underpins the work and the people who have been part of this project. It also suggests navigation routes through the site as a whole and is therefore a good place to start.

Typically, the latter are binary sums and binary products, and the former are outer compositions with a univariate intrinsic function, such as 'inv', 'exp', 'log', 'pow', 'sqrt', etc. Nearly every function that can be represented finitely on a computer is factorable. Given a factorable function, MC++ provides methods for computing bounds on that function, in the form of convex/concave relaxations, Taylor models, and spectral bounds. A main objective in developing MC++ has been to make the bounds computation as simple and natural as possible, similar to computing function values in real number arithmetic. In particular, MC++ can be quite useful for the fast prototyping and testing of new algorithms and ideas, for instance in such areas as global and robust optimization.","Software","Yes","2013","- Library incorporated into software ACADO Toolkit (http://acado.github.io/)
