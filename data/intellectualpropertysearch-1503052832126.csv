The method comprises programming the function using a programming language by defining one or more terms, each term comprising one or more functional constants. Game semantics are applied to interpret the programmed function. Each term is interpreted as one or more strategies defined on moves. Each of the constants of the programmed function is associated with a sub-circuit. Each move is associated with at least one input or output port of the associated sub-circuit, and a move occurrence defined by a strategy produces a change of state of an associated port. The associated sub-circuits are combined to provide a synthesised circuit for performing the function.","Patent granted","US8146029","2012","No","None",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=5462799808b3a9.87001094&grantRef=EP%2FD070880%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/D070880/1","1478668F-61D8-4F60-8BEE-03AADE35C8A1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","E3467D80-13A7-4C31-B14D-CC4C3B12086F"

The work included both fundamental studies of the synthesis and characterisation of novel polymer-supported Mo(VI) complexes and engineering development of the reactive distillation column (RDC) for olefins epoxidation. A highly active, selective and long-lived heterogeneous polymer-supported alkene epoxidation catalyst has been selected that was initially developed for use in small-scale batch reactions. A continuous alkene epoxidation reactor (Reactive Distillation column - RDC) has been successfully designed, constructed and commissioned in our laboratory. We have developed a new rolled belt shaped catalyst packing material, which is suitable for use in the process of the present invention. The advantages of this packing are very efficient mass transfer between the liquid and vapour phases, low pressure drop, and high hydraulic capacity. We have confirmed the remarkable catalytic performance of this catalyst in continuous epoxidations of cyclohexene, limonene and alpha-pinene employing tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. Very high conversion of TBHP to cyclohexene oxide (more than 98%) and 100% selectivity towards cyclohexene epoxide was achieved during epoxidation of cyclohexene in the RDC. This study confirmed that this new process is about 50% more energy efficient than the conventional processes.","Patent granted","Chinese Patent Number ZL201080044175.2","2015","No","The smaller integrated plant design leads to lower capital cost of new plant, and very importantly to lower recurrent costs in terms of energy and materials (water, steam, solvent etc.) costs. Overall therefore this new process provides many advantages to potential users: feedstock flexibility, atom efficiency, flexibility of scale of production, energy efficiency, reduced unit costs and improved profitability. Importantly as well, the new process makes a big impact on the environmental acceptability of epoxides production.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56e07ea67a6a73.91531958&grantRef=EP%2FH027653%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H027653/1","9274F5A0-9016-4489-9AC6-1257502D2568","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","FBA10D69-BE5C-42A8-9DCF-4214809173FB","32CE93E1-0371-460F-A5E6-B3F387C0A1C6"

"EPSRC","EP/D080762/1","Research Grant","Intellectual Property","University of Bristol","Physics","Cherns","David","","Solar cell for forming solar panel, solar concentrator and power plant for producing electricity comprises at least one sub-cell containing several specific indium gallium nitride nanocolumns","In solar cell comprising sub-cell(s) with several InxGa1-xN nanocolumns/nanorods, each nanocolumn/nanorod is substantially defect free; as nanocolumns/nanorods vary in composition along their length, and have adjacent portions separated by tunnel junctions formed by doping nanocolumn, such that tunnel junctions are defect free. Further, under lateral growth conditions, continuous layer is grown on top of nanocolumns/nanorods. The precursor layer and overlayer are doped. Continuous InxGa1-xN layers formed by lateral growth of nanocolumns/nanorods have much lower defect densities than continuous epilayers e.g. 107 to 108 cm-2, as opposed to 109 to 1010 cm-2. The nanorod/nanocolumn devices have several key advantages over devices based on continuous epilayers. The nanorods are perfect single crystals, free of threading defects (less than 108 cm-2), and remain free of defects as they grow laterally until coalescence. The nanorods are compliant structures and have right geometry such that misfit stresses can be eliminated by lateral relaxation, in content to be grown pseudomorphically on GaN base, where composition change is graded. Misfit dislocations and layer stresses which lead to phase separation can thus be avoided. This is not possible with continuous epilayers as there is 7% mismatch between GaN and InN. There is also good evidence that high crystal quality InGaN nanorods can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) for all compositions up to pure InN. If threading dislocations are generated e.g. in misfit dislocation source, they are eliminated on nanorod sides; where driving force is relaxation of strain energy. Further, threading defects can be generated in nanorods and are propagated, where they provide top surface growth step. However, for solar cell probability of such defect generation is low (less than 5-10%). Stress relaxation in nanorods also means that composition can be reversed to give InxGa1-xN overlayers with low x. Thus, enables p-type layers (needed in two-junction device) having low x value. This provides crucial flexibility in doping needed to integrate sub-cells into multi-junction device. The solar cell offers advantage of using optimum combination of band gaps for improved overall efficiency, combined with lower epitaxy and processing costs, and without use of toxic materials. The manufacturing is maskless and does not require use of etching chemicals or only in relatively small amounts. InxGa1-xN also has intrinsic properties which are advantageous for solar cells, including high optical absorption of 2x 105 cm-1, giving greater than 90% absorption in 200 nm, compared with greater than or equal to 10 microns for Si, and high carrier mobility and drift velocity which can reduce carrier recombination rates. Moreover, high piezoelectric and spontaneous electric fields present in GaN heterostructures can be used to enhance tunneling through reverse biased junctions. For x greater than 0.43, nanorod/nanocolumn surfaces show electron accumulation, although depth of electron accumulation layer should be 2-3 nm. This suggests that electrons and holes may become spatially separated, and reduce probability of electron-hole recombination","Patent granted","WO2012076901-A1 ; EP2649650-A1 ; US2013269763-A1","2011","No","The structures envisaged in the patent have been demonstrated",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=5451144eeda530.58979174&grantRef=EP%2FD080762%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/D080762/1","CA28FD29-1649-41E3-A047-C4A006CC8DA9","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","C0D6EA21-85E3-4D71-810C-C4AFE11EAA37"

The PCPs are used at the receiver to estimate the nonlinear distortion (e.g. nonlinear phase shift) of their respective original subcarriers and other subcarriers close to the PCP. With this technique, the optical fibre nonlinearity due to the Kerr effect in OFDM systems can be effectively compensated without the complexity of DBP or 50% loss in capacity of the phase conjugate twin wave (PC-TW) technique. Moreover, the technique proposed herein can be effectively implemented in both single polarization and PMD systems, in both single channel and WDM systems.","Patent application published","WO2015155520","2015","No","None at present",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56dc4405999d62.96279076&grantRef=EP%2FL000091%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/L000091/1","662441D5-76AA-474D-ABC9-DE8E5B11A78C","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5BFB9036-9D16-4AB9-A9EF-097BB6FBD69A","E1437546-354C-4238-94B0-58144DA13FE5"

More particularly, but not exclusively, the present invention relates to ion implantation in an amorphous chalcogenide material in a thermoelectric device. Background of the Invention Thermoelectric devices employ the thermoelectric effect to convert a temperature difference into an electric current, or to create a thermal gradient through the application of an electric current. Examples of thermoelectric devices include thermoelectric generators, thermocouples and thermopiles, which use the Seebeck effect to generate electricity, and Peltier heat pumps, which use the Peltier effect to pump heat from a cold side of the heat pump to a hot side. It is generally desirable to increase the efficiency of thermoelectric devices, so that a larger current can be generated for a given thermal gradient, and more heating/cooling power can be provided by a given power supply.","Patent granted","Patent number: GB1410098.6","2014","Commercial In Confidence","Discussions with a UK Venture Capital company on possible route to exploitation",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=5460da81a139a3.01456552&grantRef=EP%2FI019065%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I019065/1","D1364093-3203-4891-81AF-256C1B07FC5D","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","B85E211C-AA9E-41B7-9DF4-2D8318A12FEC"

The results are displayed both mathematically (allowing them to be used in science lessons) but also visually (via Google Maps and satellite imagery), and the calculator has been used with age groups ranging from KS2 to adult learners (via workshops at LEARN, the adult education department at Cardiff University).","Protection not required",,"","No","Talks and a poster on the D2E project were delivered by Paul Roche, Sarah Roberts and Edward Gomez at the &quot;dotcom Astronomy: networked astronomy and the new media&quot; conference (Cardiff Uni, Sept. 2008).

USE - For purifying a protein or peptide; and in the preparation of a crystal (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - Using thin films, a lower amount of protein is required, both for the imprinting and the crystallizing stage. The growth of a small number of high-quality crystals reduces number of exposed cavities. The processing step of passing the molecularly imprinted polymer through a sieve avoids the release of its template. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for screening for appropriate protein or peptide crystallization conditions involving providing a molecularly imprinted polymer imprinted with a first protein or peptide; conducting pairs of screening trials for a second protein or peptide, where each pair relating to a trial under a different one of several different sets of conditions, and one member of each pair including the molecularly imprinted polymer in a solution of the second protein or peptide and the corresponding other member of the pair including no molecularly imprinted polymer; determining the conditions under which nucleation of the second protein or peptide occurs in the trials that include the molecularly imprinted polymer, but under which no nucleation occurs in the corresponding trials including no molecularly imprinted polymer, thereby identifying metastable conditions for the second protein or peptide; and/or determining the conditions under which nucleation of the second protein or peptide occurs in the trials that include no molecularly imprinted polymer, but under which nucleation occurs at a faster rate in the corresponding trials including the molecularly imprinted polymer, thereby identifying nucleation conditions for the second protein or peptide.","Patent application published","WO2010139972","2010","Commercial In Confidence","Collaboration with other groups who wish to crystallize 'hard to crystallize' proteins in Brazil.

It is based on 'vertexing' techniques in particle physics developed at Imperial at DESY, SLAC, CERN and Fermilab. It has now been adopted by most of the top large pharmaceutical companies. Most notably, it forms the basis of the analytical platform of choice in the US Government's multi$10s of million DOD Rapid Vaccine Development programmes (through DARPA and DTRA) with systems installed on the East and West Coast.","Patent granted",,"","Commercial In Confidence","The mandate is to be able to produce 3m vaccines inside 12 weeks of a birdflu outbreak.

It has also been adopted as a 'workhorse' technology in an Emirate for diagnostics, breast cancer and diabetes. In this nation, adult onset diabetes affects about 30% of the population and ultra-high throughput accurate and reliable systems are mandatory.

Five compounds showed high activity toward Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while 9b and 9c were highly active also against multi-drug resistant clinical isolates. Compound 9c showed low eukaryotic cell toxicity, turning out to be an excellent lead candidate for preclinical trials.

In particular, resonant CARS signals have a real and imaginary component. The imaginary component is directly related to the spontaneous Raman spectrum, for which there are already large spectral databases to allow chemical identification. The NRB signal, on the other hand, only has a real component. Within embodiments of the invention we recover the imaginary component of the entire CARS signal by simultaneously generating two CARS signals at orthogonal polarisations: one has the imaginary components destructively interfering with (i.e. subtracted from) the real components, the other has them constructively interfering. Measuring these two polarisations and subtracting them therefore cancels out the real part of the signal, leaving only the imaginary components.","Patent granted","WO2012017201","2012","No","None yet",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=m-2399124607.815523766ae0b0&grantRef=BB%2FF016344%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/F016344/1","A7CB685A-370A-4D77-B60A-D9254D94A5D6","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","318B5D98-4CB4-4B10-A876-08FC93071A56","C4FDEEFA-4D7D-45A9-8B77-9048D3FA0D3B"

Specifically, the required antenna radiation will be mapped onto the Fresnel Zone, where its spatial relationship with the source field can be established mathematically. We have developed an analytical as well as a numerical technique, which transforms the spatial distribution of fields through custom designed materials.

"MRC","MR/J005134/1","Research Grant","Intellectual Property","University of Bristol","Clinical Science at North Bristol","Gill","Steven","","Patent Filed Ref P117522GB - Your ref: CED","Glioblastoma is an untreatable from of brain tumour. Treatment by surgery or chemotherapy fails to prevent tumour recurrence and progression, leading to inevitable death. Previous studies have demonstrated that the majority of recurrences occur within 2cm of the original tumour site, indicating that the major cause of recurrence is microscopic tumour invasion into peritumoral brain tissue. The unmet need addressed by this invention is to target encapsulated chemotherapy nanospheres to peritumoral brain tissue in order to reduce the incidence of tumour recurrence and to prolong disease-free survival This invention builds upon extensive experience at NBT / UoB in Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED). CED is a means of delivering controlled quantities of drug directly into the brain using in-dwelling catheters and carefully controlled concentration / pressure gradients. This methodology has been developed over the past 10 years by Professor Stephan Gill in collaboration with Renishaw Plc. His team are currently treating malignant brain tumours in adult and paediatric patients with CED of carboplatin. This treatment strategy is based upon substantial pre-clinical and clinical data suggesting carboplatin directly delivered to brain tumours could be effective in controlling disease progression. However, CED of free carboplatin has a number of limitations that the current invention seeks to overcome. These include: - Carboplatin is not specifically toxic to tumour cells and could therefore result in neurotoxicity - Carboplatin is cleared from the brain relatively quickly following CED. Consequently it is necessary to perform repeat infusions over 2 to 3 days in order to maintain exposure of the tumour to therapeutic drug concentrations. Over the past 15 months the team have been working in collaboration with the Universities of Bath and Nottingham to develop and test the encapsulation of carboplatin in Polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) nanospheres / nanoparticles, with the specific aim of addressing the above limitations. PLGA is an FDA-approved biodegradable and biocompatible co-polymer used widely in the pharmaceutical industry. Through CED pilot studies the team have been able to devised a number of criteria in relation to nanosphere formulation and characteristics with the aim of developing carboplatin/PLGA nanospheres optimised for CED. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time carboplatin/PLGA nanospheres have been formulated specifically for delivery by CED for the treatment of brain tumours. In summary, the invention is a specific formulation of carboplatin/PLGA therapy for use in combination with CED for the treatment of brain tumours.","Copyrighted (e.g. software)",,"2013","No","The potential impact on covering our novel aspect, data generated from this grant application",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=bFQKeD7duGc&grantRef=MR%2FJ005134%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/J005134/1","561889C8-22D5-4898-B746-75B3967CD3B7","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","7807E7B0-0709-4728-B283-5B83F76D0B5D"

In the second step the low-power implantable platform amplifies and filters the extracellular recording, performs ADC and detects action potentials, which can be matched on-chip to the predetermined templates generated by the external receiver in the first step. This two-step approach exploits the advantages of both offline and online processing, providing an effective and safe method for performing multiple recordings of single-neuron activity, for research or monitoring applications or for control of a remote device.","Patent application published","WO2015114347","2015","No","A series of high profile scientific papers, as listed with the project.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56ded30bc020f6.55011794&grantRef=EP%2FH051651%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H051651/1","6DBBDDFA-1328-4689-B001-C0487B315E0D","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","C842A34F-18F7-454D-A259-FED802368496","559FDBD3-5EE9-4309-AED9-8D65439A0700"

An electroless plating solution is then provided on the photocatalyst layer, and the photocatalyst layer and electroless plating solution are illuminated with actinic radiation whereby deposition of metal from the electroless plating solution to form a metal layer on the photocatalyst layer is initiated whereby the metal deposits in the voids of the mask layer. The mask layer is subsequently removed to leave a porous metal layer on the substrate.

However, variations in the optical path length during the finite measurement time severely limit the applicability of the method in real world environments. By the use of a second swept source measurements become immune to these variations. The use of a second source implies a great increase in costs and complexity. In this invention, we use four wave mixing for the generation of the secondary swept frequency source. This greatly reduces the increase in costs and solves the synchronization issues often encountered by dual laser systems. A prototype has been built and tested against induced variations in the optical path length, proving the ability of the technique to improve distance measurements in industrial environments.","Patent granted","GB1411206.4","2014","Yes","The proposed dual laser frequency sweep interferometry have promising applications in high precision distance measurements in real time in industrial environments where large components are being assembled or machines are operating.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56d1698d483ab8.25221117&grantRef=EP%2FI029613%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I029613/1","B6511B42-D90C-45AF-9CA0-9801D4CDAD7F","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","7B3A72B2-7C68-4D1C-A7ED-102C7805B561","6BADF837-F1F0-4CC7-AB1C-DC3770DA85C9"

Spin transfer is achieved using a template having sites of ordered environment, and the fluid and the compound are brought together in the presence of the template.

These algorithms include creating layers orthogonal to a viewing direction, the separate layers representing different depths in the image. The layers are created based on knowing the color and depth of each point in the image. Each layer then goes through an FFT process until the information for each layer is represented as a diffraction pattern. A holographic lens is then applied to the diffraction pattern of each layer. This lens will cause that layer to appear, in a hologram based thereon, at a different depth than the other layers. The layers, each with their separate lenses, are then coherently summed up and when applied to a suitable portion of a holographic display system (e.g., an SLM), a hologram can be created for that view. A tiled array of such holograms can be combined together by the holographic display system.","Patent application published","Patent application number: 20150277378","","No","-",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56ded4626eb882.53007785&grantRef=EP%2FH00274X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H00274X/1","75307C8B-D922-4DC9-82F6-B205BFC953CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","2996A10D-439A-4F40-A698-2FE4F48E771F"

The radiation transmission properties of the first and second states are different. The composition comprises: (A) a liquid crystal material that has a positive dielectric anisotropy and that is a uniformly aligned smectic A structure when in the first state; (B) an ionic dopant giving a negative conductivity anisotropy in the liquid crystal material so that it is capable of disrupting the smectic A structure of the first state when subject to an electric field that causes the dopant to migrate through the composition, thereby causing the composition to switch into said at least one second state, and (C) optically anisotropic pigment particles having positive dielectric anisotropy dispersed in the composition, the largest dimension of the pigment particles being in the range of 10nm to 1 [mu]m. The composition, when in the first relatively stable state, is capable of undergoing smectic dynamic scattering due to electro-hydrodynamic instability under the influence of a sufficiently low frequency AC field, thereby disordering the liquid crystals and the pigment particles and thereby discouraging the pigment particles from aggregating together. The composition is suitable for use in displays and is especially resistant to degradation by ambient light and so can be used in outside applications.","Patent granted","WO2012095627","2012","Commercial In Confidence","NA",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=m-8644312190.491997766aec22&grantRef=EP%2FH00274X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H00274X/1","75307C8B-D922-4DC9-82F6-B205BFC953CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","2996A10D-439A-4F40-A698-2FE4F48E771F"

In this RRM the resource is dynamically allocated in distributed and centralized manners such that spectral and energy efficiency is maximized across the whole network. To achieve this a unique interference mapping strategy is implemented to assist in deciding whether a distributed or centralized mode is applicable per basestation. When a distributed approach is granted to a basestation it can use the entire spectrum while when a centralized approach is imposed on a basestation it will only be allocated a subset of the spectrum. The proposed then utilizes the confederation concept in the sense that once the allocation approach is determined the individual basestations can take control of their allocated resource. When combined with proportional fairness scheduling, this RRM can also exploits multiuser diversity. It was shown through mathematical analysis and computer simulations that this technique offers significant improvements in terms of energy efficiency and quality of service by increasing the guaranteed data rate per user.","Patent granted","GB2013/000344","2014","No","The invention has attracted &pound;90k of funding from an investment company called IP Group for further tests and developments to be carried out.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56e16a82743184.64361659&grantRef=EP%2FJ021768%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/J021768/1","E59DD3D6-2B78-468B-B961-35B0FE55C85D","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","448D5751-9CD3-4984-BD24-C4A5CE5489E7"

The work included both fundamental studies of the synthesis and characterisation of novel polymer-supported Mo(VI) complexes and engineering development of the reactive distillation column (RDC) for olefins epoxidation. A highly active, selective and long-lived heterogeneous polymer-supported alkene epoxidation catalyst has been selected that was initially developed for use in small-scale batch reactions. A continuous alkene epoxidation reactor (Reactive Distillation column - RDC) has been successfully designed, constructed and commissioned in our laboratory. We have developed a new rolled belt shaped catalyst packing material, which is suitable for use in the process of the present invention. The advantages of this packing are very efficient mass transfer between the liquid and vapour phases, low pressure drop, and high hydraulic capacity. We have confirmed the remarkable catalytic performance of this catalyst in continuous epoxidations of cyclohexene, limonene and alpha-pinene employing tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. Very high conversion of TBHP to cyclohexene oxide (>98%) and 100% selectivity towards cyclohexene epoxide was achieved during epoxidation of cyclohexene in the RDC. This study confirmed that this new process is about 50% more energy efficient than the conventional processes.","Patent granted","US Patent Number US 8,759,552 B2","2011","No","The smaller integrated plant design leads to lower capital cost of new plant, and very importantly to lower recurrent costs in terms of energy and materials (water, steam, solvent etc.) costs. Overall therefore this new process provides many advantages to potential users: feedstock flexibility, atom efficiency, flexibility of scale of production, energy efficiency, reduced unit costs and improved profitability. Importantly as well, the new process makes a big impact on the environmental acceptability of epoxides production.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=5463b728192701.75196497&grantRef=EP%2FC530950%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/C530950/1","D0D85868-4DE0-4555-8177-5BFFF3884A4F","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","CAA9A40D-0226-4A4F-AC0D-D8299E30A1EF","32CE93E1-0371-460F-A5E6-B3F387C0A1C6"

The development covered by this patent filing relates to performing EDXRD in a substantially back-reflection geometry (2-theta close to 180-deg), in which case the XRD signal becomes almost completely insensitive to the sample morphology. This characteristic opens up the possibility of analysing unprepared samples; for example, unprepared rock specimens in a geological context. The patent also describes how to selectively suppress fluorescence peaks in order to uncover diffraction peaks which are otherwise obscured.","Patent application published","W02013156763","","No","Protection is being sought in the US, Europe and Australia: US2015092921, EP2839269, AU2013250980.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56b99b7d1457b8.86219338&grantRef=ST%2FL000148%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=ST/L000148/1","7B696322-1CE7-4503-898D-43599DC1CDAB","D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3","C842A34F-18F7-454D-A259-FED802368496","E727FC1D-3E04-4C48-9C56-7B5546097D35"

A layer of amphipathic molecules such as a lipid is formed around the surfaces of the droplets. This may be achieved by providing the lipid in the oil and leaving the droplets for a time sufficient to form the layer. The droplets are brought into contact with one another so that a bilayer of the amphipathic molecules is formed as an interface between the contacting droplets. The bilayers may be used for a wide range of studies. The technique has numerous advantages including providing a long lifetime for the bilayers, allowing study of small volumes and allowing the construction of chains and networks of droplets with bilayers in between to study complex systems.","Patent granted","WO2008012552","2008","Commercial In Confidence","IP has been licensed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=Dj2tNvy8NYo&grantRef=G0300122","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0300122","2DCEFF38-6B1E-4011-8F2B-BFA9227A3E0F","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","513A5B82-EA5B-42DE-87B7-52D0E8132590"

Further, the present invention relates to a method of constructing high quality optoelectronic devices using the wafer. In particular, the present invention relates to an improved LED having a silicon substrate that minimises the dislocation-defects that occur when larger support wafers are used. A gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor substrate for grown of nitride semiconductor devices comprises an underlying wafer that carries a first GaN layer that has one or more very thin silicon nitride SiNx inter-layers therein. These Si N x inter-layer(s) are 0.5nm to 10nm thick and the GaN penetrates through one or more portions of the inter-layer preferably to form discrete crystalline structures (3D GaN). Preferably these crystalline structures help reduce threading dislocations when the GaN layer is grown, by MOVPE for example. Additionally, below the GaN layer, an aluminium nitride AlN nucleation layer may lie on the underlying wafer with an aluminium gallium nitride AlGaN buffer layer above the AlN and below the GaN layer. The underlying wafer may be silicon Si.; The AlGaN layer may have a graded alloy content so the amount of aluminium decreases from the Si wafer towards the GaN layer. The GaN layer may be undoped and a second, doped, GaN layer may be formed on top, the dopant concentration of Si or Ge increasing with increasing distance from the first undoped GaN layer. Devices may be formed including MQW structures which may comprise LED or Solar (photovoltaic) devices. The substrate may be from 6 inches (15cm) to 12 inches (30cm) in diameter.","Patent granted","GB2485418(B)","2010","Yes","This patent was transferred to a Cambridge spin-out, CamGaN Ltd, for commercial exploitation of the technology described in the patent.

This novel protein has been designated PD-L3. Like other members of the PD-L1 family, PD-L3 co-stimulates aCD3 proliferation of T cells in vitro. In addition, the expression of PD-L3 is increased in aCD3-activated Treg and reduced in the presence of aGITR. A second, TNF-like, protein has also been identified as being upregulated upon aCD3/aGITR stimulation. This protein has been designated Treg-sTNF. These proteins may be involved in contact-dependent and paracrine suppression of immunity and can therefore be used to modulate immune responses and treat diseases and conditions involving Treg signaling.

"EPSRC","EP/H050353/1","Research Grant","Intellectual Property","Loughborough University","Sch of Mechanical and Manufacturing Eng","Garner","Colin","","Turbo Discharghing","Delivering an effective engine air system is critical to the success of powertrain products. Using a novel divided exhaust flow arrangement, the blow-down flow from the engine cylinders and the associated energy usually lost as part of the exhaust gas flow is recovered by a turbine. During the main displacement flow from the engine the turbine is by-passed and the crankshaft does not have to do any work exhausting the burnt gases through the turbine. The result is the recovery of the blowdown energy without negatively impacting the engine crankshaft torque. This energy is then used to depressurise the exhaust system which generates extra crankshaft torque during the exhaust stroke giving a primary torque increase and CO2 emission reduction. Secondary benefits (not included in the above fuel economy estimates) include increased energy availability from the blowdown pulse and potentially improved low speed torque (through increased pressure drop across the turbine). There will be less hot exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder which will extend the knock limit of turbocharged spark ignition engines allowing further downsizing or increased compression ratio. Importantly, the effect on the combustion system is small allowing the Turbo-Discharging approach to be used with all current and future IC engines without significant redesign. The technology requires the addition of: 1.A turbocharger like turbo-machine (no VGT, possibly a wastegate - but not essential) 2.A heat exchanger comparable to an EGR heat exchanger 3.A more complex exhaust manifold with one connection to each exhaust port The addition of a heat exchanger is not necessary when applying to a powertrain that includes exhaust thermal energy recover. The technology is additive and can work directly with turbocharging systems. The addition of turbo-discharging increases the energy that can be extracted from the exhaust gases allowing fuel economy improvements and potential improvements in engine transient response Patents: An Exhaust Arrangement For An Internal Combustion Engine - Novel turbo air system.

Currently, custom made chip holders are utilized along with/or individual fluidic interconnects; all current solutions require skilled and experienced people to handle them and attach them appropriately to avoid leakages. Most of these rely in attaching interconnects vertically, through vias, and utilizing sealing apparatuses like o-rings or ferrules, while all horizontal geometries rely in mechanical bolting of the interconnects to thick, rigid (eg glass) substrates. With our invention we supply a plug and play, side-interfacing solution embodied in the microfluidic chip substrate itself, eliminating the problem of chip inlet sealing. The interfacing relies on the self-alignment of the microfluidic chip interfacing with the external interconnect, through a comb-like geometry. This geometry is realized directly on the microfluidic chip by micromachining it to the desired shape, thus eliminating the need for additional assembly steps of external connectors that typically compromise the sealing integrity.","Patent granted","GB 1415404.1","2014","No","This technique allows to effortlessly and reliably link a disposable fluidic cartridge with an analyser.

The interference of the counter- propagating beams can eliminate or substantially reduce Joule loss of light energy in the metamaterial layer or, on the contrary, can lead to a near total absorption of light, depending on the mutual phase and/or intensity of the interacting beams.

The work included both fundamental studies of the synthesis and characterisation of novel polymer-supported Mo(VI) complexes and engineering development of the reactive distillation column (RDC) for olefins epoxidation. A continuous alkene epoxidation reactor (Reactive Distillation column - RDC) has been successfully designed, constructed and commissioned in our laboratory. We have developed a new rolled belt shaped catalyst packing material, which is suitable for use in the process of the present invention. The advantages of this packing are very efficient mass transfer between the liquid and vapour phases, low pressure drop, and high hydraulic capacity. We have confirmed the remarkable catalytic performance of this catalyst in continuous epoxidations of cyclohexene, limonene and alpha-pinene employing tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. Very high conversion of TBHP to cyclohexene oxide (more than 98%) and 100% selectivity towards cyclohexene epoxide was achieved during epoxidation of cyclohexene in the RDC. This study confirmed that this new process is about 50% more energy efficient than the conventional processes.","Patent granted","US 9,248,942 B2","","No","The smaller integrated plant design leads to lower capital cost of new plant, and very importantly to lower recurrent costs in terms of energy and materials (water, steam, solvent etc.) costs. Overall therefore this new process provides many advantages to potential users: feedstock flexibility, atom efficiency, flexibility of scale of production, energy efficiency, reduced unit costs and improved profitability. Importantly as well, the new process makes a big impact on the environmental acceptability of epoxides production.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56e07dcf1100c6.88855262&grantRef=EP%2FH027653%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H027653/1","9274F5A0-9016-4489-9AC6-1257502D2568","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","FBA10D69-BE5C-42A8-9DCF-4214809173FB","32CE93E1-0371-460F-A5E6-B3F387C0A1C6"

The patent application describes the assessment of arterial stiffness through real-time measurement of pulse-wave velocity (with Doppler, Tonography or MRI) while modulating intrathoraic pressure by breathing maneuvers.","Patent application published","WO2013110929 A1","2013","No","N/A",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=PhFRTvZR35u&grantRef=MC_G0900865","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_G0900865","BA7FE3D2-A298-43B5-A16B-2F5A2FFE163C","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","318B5D98-4CB4-4B10-A876-08FC93071A56","D527967C-F2CF-4E39-928E-B7A6E847C7B1"

Linking this knowledge to other factors in the biomass growth, for example agronomy, has helped decision making in farming practices and end uses. For example, agronomic practises can help alleviate ash-related problems in combustion, although engineering solutions are still critical for utilising the very difficult feedstocks. In addition, as a second example, it has been established that low ash is more beneficial than low lignin in fast pyrolysis, although there is interplay between ash-lignin-oil quality. Lignin content was seen to decrease with increasing ash content for Lolium and Festuca grasses and so for these feedstocks it would be difficult to obtain a low lignin, low ash material without resorting to pre-treatment. Beneficiaries of this research are growers, and businesses involved in converting biomass to energy through thermochemical means, as well as the wider research community because much of this research is fundamental in nature","Protection not required",,"","No","There has been follow-on research applying this knowledge.

The present disclosure describes a new method for determining the intersections between a set of rays and a set of triangles. The method is unique as it processes arbitrary rays and arbitrary primitives, and provides the lower complexity typical to ray-tracing algorithms without making use of a spatial subdivision data structure which would require additional memory storage. Such low memory usage is particularly beneficial to all computer systems creating 3D images where the available on-board memory is limited and critical, and must be minimized. Also, a pivot-based streaming novelty allows minimizing conditional branching inherent to normal ray-tracing techniques by handling large streams of rays. In most cases, our method displays much faster times for solving similar intersection problems than preceding state of the art methods on similar systems.","Patent granted","2011035800A2","2009","No","At this stage, we can fairly say that this technique can be extended to solve many more problems.

Specifically, our approach accounts for a driver's generalised route preferences to provide up-to-date, personalised information based on estimates of the energy required to reach every possible destination in a map. We frame this task in the context of sequential decision making and show that energy consumption in reaching a particular destination can be formulated as policy evaluation in a Markov Decision Process. In particular, we exploit the properties of the model adopted for predicting likely energy consumption to every possible destination in a realistically sized map in real-time. The policy to be evaluated is learned and, over time, refined using Inverse Reinforcement Learning to provide for a life-long adaptive system. Our approach is evaluated using a publicly available dataset providing real trajectory data of 50 individuals spanning approximately 10,000 miles of travel. We show that by accounting for driver specific route preferences our system significantly reduces the relative error in energy prediction compared to more common, driver-agnostic heuristics such as shortest-path or shortest-time routes.","Patent application published",,"2016","Yes","P.

The University of Milan, however, did patent the alternative route developed by our collaborators (see collaborations section of outcomes), and the two academic groups shared information and published he two routes (see publications section of outcomes).","Protection not required",,"","No","Discussions drew attention to the fact that other isomers were available, but development costs were too high for them to challenge the established two isomers currently in wide-spread use.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=54631656de9499.04105556&grantRef=EP%2FH009922%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H009922/1","F4B9B7BB-4FFA-407D-A222-B018BF4D371A","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","88C5F7F9-8DCC-41C9-BC4F-F37DA01075C7","60655634-1E75-4A4F-BC8B-3F277DB17CAE"

To attack this issue Bruce, in the early years of the 21st century, pioneered nanostructured intercalation electrodes, including TiO2(B) nanowires/nanotubes and mesoporous LiMn2O4 as anodes and cathodes respectively (2004/2008) [2,3]. He demonstrated that the combination of length scales in one material (micrometre, nanometre and atomic) endows materials with superior properties, and hence performance, compared with micron-sized particulate electrodes when used in lithium-ion batteries.

A set of Rheo-chips for characterisation of biofluids in shear, extensional (cross-slot flow) and contraction flow were designed, fabricated and evaluated through studying nonlinear dynamics of polymer solution (as a blood analogue) for mapping out various flow regimes, especially under extensional deformation. The technique was also applied in studying the effects of mechanical stretch to embryonic stem cell differentiation. One Rheo-chip was designed to separate cellular components of blood from plasma. It works well for blood of low haematocrit (<35%), but needs to be improved for whole blood. Rheological characterisation of whole blood and plasma were also carried out. A procedure for extracting the material functions of blood samples is established. The Rheo-chip technology has great potential to be a core technology for high throughput rheological analysis of biofluids, as lab-on-a-chip not only for clinical diagnostics but also design and manufacture of protein-based medicine.","Patent application published","WO2012017246","2012","No","The rheo-chip technology has been applied in biomedical areas - rheological and flow characterisation of biofluids such as antibody protein solutions, plasma, stem cells and whole bloods.

For low duty cycle pulse trains, the sensitivity and efficiency of CQSD is greatly reduced because of the increased energy spread across the spectrum, leading to deterioration in the SNR. SMGI is the method of choice for pulsed signals, but does not offer immunity against 1/f noise and, when the latter is overwhelming, CQSD becomes the better choice. GQSD is efficient against 1/f noise and hence improves the output SNR. It incorporates a gating function to achieve signal conditioning suitable for synchronous detection, while the QSD function ensures maximum suppression of flicker noise. An advantage of applying GQSD with low bandwidth devices, such as a PED, will be that it allows a nominally slow detector to be exploited at higher than usual frequencies. This is possible, since gained reserve in SNR can be traded against sensitivity, e.g. by reducing the electrical time constant.","Copyrighted (e.g. software)",,"","No","Interest has been stated by Ametek UK.

It is to be noted that it is an advantage of the present invention that de novo Foxp3 expression is being induced. This is contrasted with the situation in the prior art where the best effect shown to date has been the expansion of T cells which are already expressing Foxp3. The opportunity to actively induce Foxp3 expression in cells which are not currently expressing it is a significant advantage of the present invention.
We show that small molecule inhibitors of the PI3K/mTOR pathway rapidly and efficiently induce the de novo expression of Foxp3, the signature transcription factor of the Treg cell lineage. This enables new therapeutic approaches to be applied to clinical settings where the de novo generation of Treg cells is desirable, such as the prevention and the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

The metallic ring supports a surface plasmon whose energy is matched to the energy, i.e. wavelength, of an incident light beam so that the oscillating electromagnetic field of the light resonates with the plasmon. The resonating plasmon causes a temperature difference to arise between the two inter-metallic junctions in the ring. The different Seebeck coefficients of the two metals results in the temperature difference causing a net current to flow around the ring, which in turn generates a magnetic field. Such a thermoelectric metamaterial ring transforms high frequency optical energy into long duration magnetic radiation pulses in the terahertz range. Applications of these devices include high density magnetic recording, magnetic field spectroscopy, and efficient terahertz radiation sources.","Patent granted","US 13/733,338","2012","No","The metamaterial magnetic field generator concept underpins ongoing doctoral research work, international collaboration with colleagues at ICFO, Spain, and discussions with potential industrial research sponsors/partners.

"NERC","fsf010001","Other Grant","Intellectual Property","National Centre for Earth Observation",,"Mac Arthur","Alasdair","","Piccolo spectrometer systems","This IP is for a field spectrometer system utilising either one or multiple commercially available enclosed-path optical benches. This instrument can be configured to make scientific quality measurements of surface radiance and sky irradiance (2 channel) or surface radiance, sky radiance and sky irradiance (3 channel) when mounted on UAVs, hand- held or mounted on a mast or tripod 'near-ground' to make spectral measurements as individual target/reference sets or to continuously make these measurements and log them in predetermined sequences and at specified time intervals. The idea is to provide a spectrometer system based on a closed path optical bench which could be modular and designed either to measure across the UV, VNIR, SWIR spectral ranges (including regions to measure photosynthetic fluorescence) or any combination of these with a novel optical path switching mechanism. This switching mechanism will enable a fibre optic light input (bifurcated, double bifurcated, trifurcated or double trifurcated) to be incorporated into the optical path of an otherwise open path optical bench. The novelty is having an optical shutter in the input end of each fibre rather than use an optical multiplexer to split the light and not have a shutter in the spectrometer and to have a multi core fibre optic cable with individual fibres aligned with the spectrometer input slit and each fibre diameter optimised for that channels purpose and spectral range. 1 - Only one low cost spectrometer is required to make both reference and target measurements = lower cost & no interpolation of data required 2 - Reference and target measurements would be near simultaneous, only separated by 10s of milliseconds 3 - Same instrument could be used for hand-held, UAV or logging use 4 - Individual fibre diameter in the bifurcated, double bifurcated, trifurcated or double trifurcated fibre optic cable could be selected to maximise light throughput 5 - Individual fibres can be aligned along optical bench input slit to maximise light input to optical bench 6 - When multiple optical benches are used both will have the same support (record reflectance/radiance) from the same surface area","Protection not required",,"2014","No","8 systems have been provided to collaborators in UK and USA and a route-to-market is being sought",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56ddd40b664c38.78116054&grantRef=fsf010001","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=fsf010001","A2A31648-1566-4444-AF04-116D8680DF02","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","8B4F5DD7-E8D3-4F2C-B513-F7623AD25E1D","D470623E-33F1-4142-93BB-63CDF9900DA2"

Polarization is thereby transferred from a prepared fluid, which is enriched with symmetric molecules of a particular spin state (e.g. para-hydrogen enriched), directly to the hyperpolarizable nuclei of a compound, without altering the chemical identity of the compound in this process. Spin transfer is achieved using a template having sites of ordered environment, and the fluid and the compound are brought together in the presence of the template.

A highly active, selective and long-lived heterogeneous polymer-supported alkene epoxidation catalyst has been selected that was initially developed for use in small-scale batch reactions. A continuous alkene epoxidation reactor (Reactive Distillation column - RDC) has been successfully designed, constructed and commissioned in our laboratory. We have developed a new rolled belt shaped catalyst packing material, which is suitable for use in the process of the present invention. The advantages of this packing are very efficient mass transfer between the liquid and vapour phases, low pressure drop, and high hydraulic capacity. We have confirmed the remarkable catalytic performance of this catalyst in continuous epoxidations of cyclohexene, limonene and alpha-pinene employing tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. Very high conversion of TBHP to cyclohexene oxide (>98%) and 100% selectivity towards cyclohexene epoxide was achieved during epoxidation of cyclohexene in the RDC. This study confirmed that this new process is about 50% more energy efficient than the conventional processes.","Patent application published","WO/2011/012869","2011","No","The smaller integrated plant design leads to lower capital cost of new plant, and very importantly to lower recurrent costs in terms of energy and materials (water, steam, solvent etc.) costs. Overall therefore this new process provides many advantages to potential users: feedstock flexibility, atom efficiency, flexibility of scale of production, energy efficiency, reduced unit costs and improved profitability. Importantly as well, the new process makes a big impact on the environmental acceptability of epoxides production.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=5463b4dbf326e2.72602635&grantRef=EP%2FC530950%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/C530950/1","D0D85868-4DE0-4555-8177-5BFFF3884A4F","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","CAA9A40D-0226-4A4F-AC0D-D8299E30A1EF","32CE93E1-0371-460F-A5E6-B3F387C0A1C6"

The resulting hepatocytes exhibit efficient hepatocyte specification, organisation, maturation and significant improvements in cell function and stability. It is believed that the laminins suppress inappropriate gene regulatory networks controlling cell proliferation, cell migration, stem cell self-renewal, and colon and fibroblast specification.

The subject typically is in need of improving skin scar colour matching, for example reducing scar hyperpigmentation, because the subject has or is at risk of hyperpigmentation. The subject typically is selected as being at risk of hyperpigmentation on the basis of one or more of the following factors: the subject has previously developed hyperpigmentation of a scar - the subject tans readily on exposure to sunshine or ultraviolet (UV) radiation, rather than burning - the subject has a non-Caucasian racial origin - the subject's skin colour (for example in an area that is not tanned) is considered to be darker than that typical of a naturally fair-haired Caucasian person. The subject may be selected as being at risk of hyperpigmentation because they are at least predominantly of Chinese, black African, Asian or Southern European racial origin, and/or if their skin type can be assessed under the Fitzpatrick Scale as Type III, IV, V or VI.","Patent application published","WO2014135896","2014","No","Supported the submission of a DPFS grant in November 2014",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=54523ee927c6e0.66187540&grantRef=G0901844","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0901844","141D617B-BD44-47FB-A8D5-6F455CC0DD93","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","C842A34F-18F7-454D-A259-FED802368496","80F85A3B-DD54-4C37-BE5C-71696E43C489"

"EPSRC","EP/I035501/1","Research Grant","Intellectual Property","University of Bristol","Physics","Cherns","David","","Solar cell for forming solar panel, solar concentrator and power plant for producing electricity comprises at least one sub-cell containing several specific indium gallium nitride nanocolumns","In solar cell comprising sub-cell(s) with several InxGa1-xN nanocolumns/nanorods, each nanocolumn/nanorod is substantially defect free; as nanocolumns/nanorods vary in composition along their length, and have adjacent portions separated by tunnel junctions formed by doping nanocolumn, such that tunnel junctions are defect free. Further, under lateral growth conditions, continuous layer is grown on top of nanocolumns/nanorods. The precursor layer and overlayer are doped. Continuous InxGa1-xN layers formed by lateral growth of nanocolumns/nanorods have much lower defect densities than continuous epilayers e.g. 107 to 108 cm-2, as opposed to 109 to 1010 cm-2. The nanorod/nanocolumn devices have several key advantages over devices based on continuous epilayers. The nanorods are perfect single crystals, free of threading defects (less than 108 cm-2), and remain free of defects as they grow laterally until coalescence. The nanorods are compliant structures and have right geometry such that misfit stresses can be eliminated by lateral relaxation, in content to be grown pseudomorphically on GaN base, where composition change is graded. Misfit dislocations and layer stresses which lead to phase separation can thus be avoided. This is not possible with continuous epilayers as there is 7% mismatch between GaN and InN. There is also good evidence that high crystal quality InGaN nanorods can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) for all compositions up to pure InN. If threading dislocations are generated e.g. in misfit dislocation source, they are eliminated on nanorod sides; where driving force is relaxation of strain energy. Further, threading defects can be generated in nanorods and are propagated, where they provide top surface growth step. However, for solar cell probability of such defect generation is low (less than 5-10%). Stress relaxation in nanorods also means that composition can be reversed to give InxGa1-xN overlayers with low x. Thus, enables p-type layers (needed in two-junction device) having low x value. This provides crucial flexibility in doping needed to integrate sub-cells into multi-junction device. The solar cell offers advantage of using optimum combination of band gaps for improved overall efficiency, combined with lower epitaxy and processing costs, and without use of toxic materials. The manufacturing is maskless and does not require use of etching chemicals or only in relatively small amounts. InxGa1-xN also has intrinsic properties which are advantageous for solar cells, including high optical absorption of 2x 105 cm-1, giving greater than 90% absorption in 200 nm, compared with greater than or equal to 10 microns for Si, and high carrier mobility and drift velocity which can reduce carrier recombination rates. Moreover, high piezoelectric and spontaneous electric fields present in GaN heterostructures can be used to enhance tunneling through reverse biased junctions. For x greater than 0.43, nanorod/nanocolumn surfaces show electron accumulation, although depth of electron accumulation layer should be 2-3 nm. This suggests that electrons and holes may become spatially separated, and reduce probability of electron-hole recombination","Patent granted","WO2012076901-A1 ; EP2649650-A1 ; US2013269763-A1","2011","No","The structures envisaged in the patent have been demonstrated",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=5451144eeda530.58979174&grantRef=EP%2FI035501%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I035501/1","96C84189-C312-446F-B046-887E1B8CC7B3","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","C0D6EA21-85E3-4D71-810C-C4AFE11EAA37"

Polymeric resins used for fibre-reinforced composites, in particular unsaturated polyester and vinyl esters, are flammable and in fire conditions burn, most often with heavy soot and smoke. All available methods of flame retarding them have certain drawbacks. An alternative means of improving flame retardancy is to co-blend these matrix polymer with one having reduced flammability such as a phenolic resin. Unfortunately, matrix polymers like polyesters and vinyl esters are incompatible with phenolic resins. The present invention has been made from a consideration of this by providing a method blending two polymeric materials (a) and (b) as specified herein:- (a) at least one of unsaturated polyester or vinyl ester; and (b) at least one of chemically modified phenolic resin, melamine resin or any other char forming resin, such as polyfurfuryl alcohol or furan resins.

Most people infected with M. tuberculosis remain asymptomatic, termed latent TB, with a 10% lifetime risk of developing active TB disease, but current tests cannot identify which individuals will develop disease 3. The immune response to M. tuberculosis is complex and incompletely characterized, hindering development of new diagnostics, therapies and vaccines 4,5. We identified a whole blood 393 transcript signature for active TB in intermediate and high burden settings, correlating with radiological extent of disease and reverting to that of healthy controls following treatment. A subset of latent TB patients had signatures similar to those in active TB patients. We also identified a specific 86-transcript signature that discriminated active TB from other inflammatory and infectious diseases. Modular and pathway analysis revealed that the TB signature was dominated by a neutrophil-driven interferon (IFN)-inducible gene profile, consisting of both IFN-? and Type I IFNaß signalling. Comparison with transcriptional signatures in purified cells and flow cytometric analysis, suggest that this TB signature reflects both changes in cellular composition and altered gene expression. Although an IFN signature was also observed in whole blood of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), their complete modular signature differed from TB with increased abundance of plasma cell transcripts.

The spacing between the mirror determines the efficiency of elastic and inelastic scattering of electromagnetic radiation inside the microcavity, and hence, determines a resonance wavelength of electronic radiation that is coupled to the microcavity. The resonance wavelength is tunable by selecting the dimensional and material parameters of the microcavity.

Until now, CMOS technologies have been proposed with increased sensitivity, however too expensive to be disposable, due to the difficulty of interfacing them with microfluidic channels, delivering the biological sample. The low-cost approach of passive electrode sensors traditionally exploits planar geometries. With our invention we propose increasing the effective sensing area of the sensing electrodes, extending them in the z-direction in a cylindrical geometry. This way we have a 2*L/r larger effective sensing area (L:via depth, r:via radius, L>r), thus increasing sensing sensitivity within the same chip footprint. The second innovation of this sensing geometry we propose is that the sample volume to be analysed (directly affecting sensing reliability and repeatability) is easily confined and predefined by the size of the cylinder (Vsample=pr2L). This concept is easily implementable in PCB technologies (conventional via drilling, Cu / Au plating), maintaining the cost of the diagnostic device low, allowing for PCB microfluidics integration. This cylindrical electrode can be functionalized to sense application-driven diseases by printing/immobilizing the antibodies of interest in each well.","Patent granted","GB 1415405","2014","No","Our sensing approach is rather versatile as the sensing specificity arises from the type of antibodies that are blinded on the sensors' surface. As such, we are already exploiting this technology for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of various diseases (eg. prostate cancer - in collaboration with Dr S. Garbis - Faculty of Medicine, Southampton) in a low-cost manner.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=54648a778e2166.73286320&grantRef=EP%2FL020920%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/L020920/1","E21B247F-29EE-4CF4-B1A4-CE4AF1EBAC5A","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","4ABE9703-ED00-4575-ACAF-4B4605F1D02E"

The channel in cross-section has a perimeter length |S |and an area |O|. The cross-section of the non-vertical channel is selected so as to define a constant Lagrange multiplier ?, where ?= |S |cos ? / |O|. A functional F [G*] ? |G*| - cos ? |S* | + (1/a2)G* +? |O*| is minimised to define a minimum value F0 =MinF. At a critical transition where F=0, the fluid defines a smooth arc of length [G*] that divides the cross-section of the channel into two parts. |O*| is the cross-sectional area of the fluid, which has a curve of length |S* | in contact with the channel, and G* represents a vertical position of the centre of mass of the fluid multiplied by the cross-sectional area |O*|. How far the fluid meniscus extends along the channel is controlled by one or more parameters of the functional F [G*].","Patent granted","WO2015121629","2015","No","ISIS Project 9544 involves a method for controlling fluid menisci in micro- and nano-fluidic devices from mesoscopic to a nanoscopic scale. The method can be used to control how far the fluid meniscus extends along the channel without emptying, and can be used to force the draining of much smaller channels than previously possible.

This meniscus deformation has several advantages that could find applications in a number of science and technology sectors:

Increasing the liquid-gas or fluid-fluid interfacial area for chemical reaction, analysis or catalysis

Forcing the draining of liquids and gases out of the capillary

Measuring any of the system control parameters with high accuracy; contact angles, capillary length and surface tensions.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56df0feee92484.84930115&grantRef=EP%2FJ009636%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/J009636/1","D47E59B6-B603-4C7A-9AE9-F69BD0EC5E5F","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","B656FF18-43CB-4696-B9B1-0A57306533A6"

The invention also relates to methods for the measurement of the liquid content, particularly the moisture content of fluidised particles.","Patent granted","WO2009030876","2013","No","As a result of continuous support from EPSRC, this patent (WO/2009/030876) has been filed by UMIP and licensed to GEA. It covers EU, USA, Australia, China and India. Fluidised beds are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. However, they are operated by trial-and-error because of the lack of online tools to measure the process. This patent details how to measure the moisture of particles and the moisture distribution in a fluidised bed by electrical capacitance tomography. The invented approach would result in revolutionary improvement on operation of pharmaceutical fluidised beds.

"MRC","G0800649","Research Grant","Intellectual Property","University of Southampton","Inflammation Infection and Repair","Howarth","Peter","","University of Southampton for MicroRNA Treatment for Asthma (11413 / BB Ref. JDM68318P.USP)","Multiple targeting of microRNAs as a therapy for asthma Scientific Summary: Multiple targeting of microRNAs as a therapy for asthma and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The idea is based on the results that we have obtained in our laboratory, where we have observed a dysregulation in the expression of several microRNAs, both in Asthma and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). We did not stop at this descriptive fact, but studied the implications of this dysregulation, focusing on different microRNAs in different cells types and processes. This approach has facilitated the discovery of synergies or collaborations between multiple microRNAs. We have found that multiple microRNAs may be used simultaneously as therapeutic targets, eliciting a more controlled response that individual microRNAs. Our initial experiments have shown that microRNAs that have a specific target mRNA (of therapeutic interest) in common tend to increase their affinity for this target when they are simultaneously manipulated in the cell. Having an increased preference for the common therapeutic target, these microRNAs seem to show less avidity for other targets of no therapeutic interest, reducing the potential off target effects of a potential microRNA therapy. Alveolar macrophages from asthmatics were found to significantly over express a range of miRs, including miR27, miR150, miR152, miR155 and miR375. All of these have seeding sites within the 3'UTRs of genes that lie within host defence pathways which may have a role in asthmatic exacerbation due to rhinoviral infection. MiR-150, miR-152 and miR-375, which were significantly increased in severe asthma (SA), putatively regulate TLR7 expression. Consistent with this we found TLR-7 mRNA and protein (Western blotting) to be significantly reduced in AM from volunteers with SA compared to HC (p<0.003). This was identified as functionally relevant, as AM from SA exhibited deficient interferon-beta (IFN-ß? responses to stimulation with both Imiquimod (TLR7 agonist) and HRV16 in comparison to those from HC (each p<0.05). Importantly we were able to reverse this defect using an anti-microRNA oligonucleotide mix that blocked miR-150, miR-152 and miR-375, indicative of the relevance of these miRs. This innate recognition defect will be compounded, as MiR-27, miR-152 and miR155 are predicted to target Ripk1 (which inhibits TNF-a secretion). Consistent with this we found that transfection with a mix of oligonucleotide mimics for these 3 miRs enhanced the gene expression of TNF-a in alveolar macrophages after their exposure to HRV16. Additional results also suggest the relevance of miRs to altered AM bacterial recognition in asthma. In epithelial cells from asthmatics we have found that several microRNAs are significantly downregulated (miR-18, miR19, miR-27a, miR-128 and miR-155). All of these microRNAs target the TGF-b pathway in epithelium (targeting SMAD2 and the receptor for TGF-b), an important pro-remodelling factor thought to be key in asthma pathogenesis. MicroRNA reduction in asthmatic epithelial cells increases their sensitivity to asthma, favouring expression of pro-fibrotic genes and facilitating rhinoviral replication. In samples from patients suffering of IBD we found that miR-31 and miR-155 were upregulated and that both microRNAs target IL13RA1, the mRNA for the receptor of IL13, a key cytokine in IBD. By using both pre-miR-31 and pre-miR-155 oligonucleotides simultaneously on clinical biopsies from inflamed colon, we were able to show that genes dependent on IL13 stimulation were reduced (CCL18, SOCS1). Importantly, using the pre-miR-155 oligonucleotide alone increased TNF-?, an undesired and dangerous off target effect. However, when miR-155 was combined with pre-miR-31 this effect disappeared and only the common effects (reduction of IL13 dependent genes) were apparent and further increased. We claim that, by using multiple microRNA therapy, specific to pathology related signalling pathways and to the affected cells (epithelium, macrophages, etc) we enhance the effect of a potential microRNA therapy an can reduce its off target effect.","Patent application published","United Kingdom Patent Application No: 1316651.7, Patent Application No. 14/490 280 in USA","2014","No","Work on going",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=56e8a21cb60968.13133803&grantRef=G0800649","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0800649","A778838A-6E3A-4CA2-9DAB-2CAD5C74D49A","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","A087746E-286E-423C-95D0-9E2838993CFF"

The work included both fundamental studies of the synthesis and characterisation of novel polymer-supported Mo(VI) complexes and engineering development of the reactive distillation column (RDC) for olefins epoxidation. A highly active, selective and long-lived heterogeneous polymer-supported alkene epoxidation catalyst has been selected that was initially developed for use in small-scale batch reactions. A continuous alkene epoxidation reactor (Reactive Distillation column - RDC) has been successfully designed, constructed and commissioned in our laboratory. We have developed a new rolled belt shaped catalyst packing material, which is suitable for use in the process of the present invention. The advantages of this packing are very efficient mass transfer between the liquid and vapour phases, low pressure drop, and high hydraulic capacity. We have confirmed the remarkable catalytic performance of this catalyst in continuous epoxidations of cyclohexene, limonene and alpha-pinene employing tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. Very high conversion of TBHP to cyclohexene oxide (>98%) and 100% selectivity towards cyclohexene epoxide was achieved during epoxidation of cyclohexene in the RDC.

In particular, a spectral analysis is performed on a candidate pattern to obtain a set of observation vectors. The observation vectors are decoded to produce a candidate match between the observation vectors and entries from a knowledge source. The step of decoding the vectors comprises modelling the knowledge source as a weighted finite state transducer (WFST) and the step of decoding comprises modelling the propagation of tokens through nodes of the WFST for observation vectors derived from successive frames of the candidate pattern. For each successive propagation, a list of tokens is sorted in order of their associated cost, and a pruning step is applied to remove tokens from said sorted list which go beyond a pre-determined cost threshold, before performing the next iteration.","Patent application published","PCT/GB2011/052436","","No","The work became part of a business proposition for a company MVR.

The metallic ring supports a surface plasmon whose energy is matched to the energy, i.e. wavelength, of an incident light beam so that the oscillating electromagnetic field of the light resonates with the plasmon. The resonating plasmon causes a temperature difference to arise between the two inter-metallic junctions in the ring. The different Seebeck coefficients of the two metals results in the temperature difference causing a net current to flow around the ring, which in turn generates a magnetic field. Such a thermoelectric metamaterial ring transforms high frequency optical energy into long duration magnetic radiation pulses in the terahertz range. Applications of these devices include high density magnetic recording, magnetic field spectroscopy, and efficient terahertz radiation sources.","Patent granted","US 8780677 B2","2013","No","TBA",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=54578de589dea8.25022667&grantRef=EP%2FG00515X%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/G00515X/1","D1F43AF6-CB9C-4BAD-83E4-55CFD0036B9D","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","9DB8164A-45CF-4D42-9666-315AFCF28022"

To attack this issue Bruce, in the early years of the 21st century, pioneered nanostructured intercalation electrodes, including TiO2(B) nanowires/nanotubes and mesoporous LiMn2O4 as anodes and cathodes respectively (2004/2008) [2,3]. He demonstrated that the combination of length scales in one material (micrometre, nanometre and atomic) endows materials with superior properties, and hence performance, compared with micron-sized particulate electrodes when used in lithium-ion batteries.

Further, the present invention relates to a method of constructing high quality optoelectronic devices using the wafer. In particular, the present invention relates to an improved LED having a silicon substrate that minimises the dislocation-defects that occur when larger support wafers are used. A gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor substrate for grown of nitride semiconductor devices comprises an underlying wafer that carries a first GaN layer that has one or more very thin silicon nitride SiNx inter-layers therein. These Si N x inter-layer(s) are 0.5nm to 10nm thick and the GaN penetrates through one or more portions of the inter-layer preferably to form discrete crystalline structures (3D GaN). Preferably these crystalline structures help reduce threading dislocations when the GaN layer is grown, by MOVPE for example. Additionally, below the GaN layer, an aluminium nitride AlN nucleation layer may lie on the underlying wafer with an aluminium gallium nitride AlGaN buffer layer above the AlN and below the GaN layer. The underlying wafer may be silicon Si.; The AlGaN layer may have a graded alloy content so the amount of aluminium decreases from the Si wafer towards the GaN layer. The GaN layer may be undoped and a second, doped, GaN layer may be formed on top, the dopant concentration of Si or Ge increasing with increasing distance from the first undoped GaN layer. Devices may be formed including MQW structures which may comprise LED or Solar (photovoltaic) devices. The substrate may be from 6 inches (15cm) to 12 inches (30cm) in diameter.","Patent granted","GB2485418(B)","2010","Yes","This patent was transferred to a Cambridge spin-out, CamGaN Ltd, for commercial exploitation of the technology described in the patent.

Further, the present invention relates to a method of constructing high quality optoelectronic devices using the wafer. In particular, the present invention relates to an improved LED having a silicon substrate that minimises the dislocation-defects that occur when larger support wafers are used. A gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor substrate for grown of nitride semiconductor devices comprises an underlying wafer that carries a first GaN layer that has one or more very thin silicon nitride SiNx inter-layers therein. These Si N x inter-layer(s) are 0.5nm to 10nm thick and the GaN penetrates through one or more portions of the inter-layer preferably to form discrete crystalline structures (3D GaN). Preferably these crystalline structures help reduce threading dislocations when the GaN layer is grown, by MOVPE for example. Additionally, below the GaN layer, an aluminium nitride AlN nucleation layer may lie on the underlying wafer with an aluminium gallium nitride AlGaN buffer layer above the AlN and below the GaN layer. The underlying wafer may be silicon Si.; The AlGaN layer may have a graded alloy content so the amount of aluminium decreases from the Si wafer towards the GaN layer. The GaN layer may be undoped and a second, doped, GaN layer may be formed on top, the dopant concentration of Si or Ge increasing with increasing distance from the first undoped GaN layer. Devices may be formed including MQW structures which may comprise LED or Solar (photovoltaic) devices. The substrate may be from 6 inches (15cm) to 12 inches (30cm) in diameter.","Patent granted","GB2485418(B)","2010","Yes","This patent was transferred to a Cambridge spin-out, CamGaN Ltd, for commercial exploitation of the technology described in the patent.

The present disclosure describes a new method for determining the intersections between a set of rays and a set of triangles. The method is unique as it processes arbitrary rays and arbitrary primitives, and provides the lower complexity typical to ray-tracing algorithms without making use of a spatial subdivision data structure which would require additional memory storage. Such low memory usage is particularly beneficial to all computer systems creating 3D images where the available on-board memory is limited and critical, and must be minimized. Also, a pivot-based streaming novelty allows minimizing conditional branching inherent to normal ray-tracing techniques by handling large streams of rays. In most cases, our method displays much faster times for solving similar intersection problems than preceding state of the art methods on similar systems.","Patent granted","2011035800A2","2009","No","At this stage, we can fairly say that this technique can be extended to solve many more problems.

Several reference electrodes have been proposed and utilized like saturated calomel electrodes, Ag/AgCl electrodes etc. Until now several approaches have been followed to integrate microfabricated reference electrodes in microfluidic devices, however all of them are integrated with standard metal deposition techniques on Si or paper substrates, compatible with CMOS fabricated sensors. With our invention we propose a PCB compatible fabrication process for integrating Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, in one of the possible embodiments. These PCB reference electrodes can also be integrated in multilayer PCB structures. The reference electrodes could be of planar or via architecture, with the latter simultaneously serving as an air exhaust/outlet that could minimise inconsistent sample loading in integrated microfluidic networks.","Patent granted","GB 1415406.6","2014","No","Reference electrodes stability and position with respect to the sensing electrodes could have an enormous impact on the attainable sensitivity of a point-of-care system.

In essence the composition includes a siloxane oligomer (component (a)) which may be seen to construct a layered SmA system of particular spacing and strength. Within this structure a low molar mass nematic mesogen (component (c)) is provided that may be considered to be that of a plasticiser which moderates the layer strength, while simultaneously providing tuneability to the properties of the composition, e.g. its refractive index or dielectric anisotropy. The addition of a side chain liquid crystal polysiloxane (component (d)) allows such systems to be further moderated since they can be considered as binding together the layers, both within a given layer and between layers. An ionic dopant (component (b)) is also included in the composition that migrates through the composition when low frequency electric fields are applied to the composition by the electrodes, thereby disrupting the order to the composition. Order in the composition can be restored by applying a higher frequency field that does not allow the dopant time to migrate significantly.
