# Summary of outcomes

Principal Investigators are asked to record outcomes for their research in ResearchFish. The outcomes are then made publicly available via Gateway To Research.

In Gateway To Research the following [outcome categories](http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/search/outcomes?term=*&fetchSize=25&selectedSortableField=ty&selectedSortOrder=DESC&fields=acp.d%2Cis.t%2Cprod.t%2Cpol.oid%2Cacp.oid%2Crtp.t%2Cpol.in%2Cprod.i%2Cper.pro.abs%2Cacp.i%2Ccol.org%2Cacp.t%2Cis.d%2Cis.oid%2Ccpro.rtpc%2Cprod.d%2Cstp.oid%2Crtp.i%2Crdm.oid%2Crtp.d%2Ccol.dept%2Cff.d%2Cff.c%2Ccol.pc%2Cpub.t%2Ckf.d%2Cdis.t%2Ccol.oid%2Cpro.t%2Cper.sn%2Corg.orcidId%2Cper.on%2Cff.dept%2Crdm.t%2Corg.n%2Cdis.d%2Cprod.oid%2Cso.cn%2Cdis.i%2Cpro.a%2Cpub.orcidId%2Cpol.gt%2Crdm.i%2Crdm.d%2Cso.oid%2Cper.fnsn%2Cper.org.n%2Cper.pro.t%2Cpro.orcidId%2Cpub.a%2Ccol.d%2Cper.orcidId%2Ccol.c%2Cip.i%2Cpro.gr%2Cpol.i%2Cso.t%2Cper.fn%2Ccol.i%2Cip.t%2Cff.oid%2Cstp.i%2Cso.i%2Ccpro.rcpgm%2Ccpro.hlt%2Ccol.pic%2Cso.d%2Cff.t%2Cip.d%2Cdis.oid%2Cip.oid%2Cstp.d%2Crtp.oid%2Cff.org%2Ckf.oid%2Cstp.t) are available:

1. Engagement activities
1. Collaboration
1. Further funding
1. Key findings
1. Impact summary
1. Policy influence
1. Research Tools and methods
1. Research databases and models
1. Artistic and creative products
1. Software and technical products
1. Intellectual properlty
1. Products, interventions and clinical trials
1. Spin outs

Reviewing each of these categories, the ones that are *most likely* be used to record data-related outcomes are:

1. Research Tools and methods, because it includes the sub categories:
    1. Data analysis technique
    1. Database/Collection of Data/Biological Samples
1. Research databases and models, because it includes the sub categories:
    1. Computer model/algorithm
    1. Data analysis technique
    1. Data handling & control
    1. Database/collection of data

These categories will provide the starting point of the investigation. They are stored in files:
* researchmaterialsearch-1502793014976.csv (contains 9287 outcomes)
* researchdatabaseandmodelsearch-1502793915306.csv (contains 5014 outcomes)

Note! It is not possible at first to distinguish between the sub-categories in the above files because the downloaded data nor the API provides access to this cateogrisation. The only way to identify sub-categories is via the web interface. This is something that needs to be fixed.
