PUFs generate unique outputs that are dependent on the device they are running on. PUFs can be used as a lightweight trust anchor for chips. A spinout from Queen's Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) has been working with PUF technology to develop something extraordinary. Sirona Technologies was founded at the end of 2015 by a trio of researchers Neil Hanley, Maire O'Neill, and Chongyan Gu. They've invented a tiny semiconductor IP core that provides strong, unique authentication for even the cheapest microchip. It means that any grade of device can have the highest grade of security.
By 2020 the Internet of Things is projected to consist of 50 billion connected devices, and the slew of data generated by smart devices and sensors is increasingly processed without human interaction. Widespread machine-to-machine (M2M) communications require trust between the underlying hardware devices, to ensure safety and security. Counterfeiting and refurbishing of electronic parts globally is a widespread problem, and the market to prevent it reaches in the billions. In 2020 the Internet of Things will be a $1.2 trillion market.","2016","PicoPUF (aka Sirona Technologies Ltd), a CSIT spinout new venture, has been awarded NISPConnect's prestigious INVENT Award grand prize.

Examples are: biopharmaceuticals such as anti-cancer therapies, heparin, vaccines, human hormones such as EPO; food such as nutraceuticals, betaglucans fructooligosaccahrides (FOS), human milk oligosaccharides for baby milk formula and pre/pro-biotics; materials from cellulose. Because these biomolecules are isolated from nature or obtained as waste products from bioprocessing they are often complex mixtures, which are difficult to analyse. Existing technology does not provide the level of detail and confidence required. Bio-Shape has&nbsp;developed cutting edge technology that allows us to analyse biomolecules and their behaviours under stresses, in exquisite unprecedented detail and very quickly. We use a technique called ion-mobility spectrometry to separate molecules not only based on the size but also subtle differences in their shape. We couple this with powerful mass spectrometry techniques to obtain the unprecedented exquisite detail. As an example, we are the only commercial company to offer the analysis of carbohydrate linkages a/ß as a physical measurement therefore providing confidence in the results. Bio-Shape technology will reduce R&amp;D development timelines by 5-24 months, extend patent life and bring more effective, highly selective products to patients faster. We will help industries to find added value products and intermediates from their waste streams and help companies to bring more well-defined products to market faster. We stay at the forefront in method and instrument development through research grant awards and close collaboration with instrument providers. This ensures that we have the most novel and powerful techniques available. We work closely with our customers to deliver fit-for-purpose solutions with clear and concise reports.","2015","Too early to comment.","http://www.bio-shape.com","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=56dec02c7b4307.82107349&grantRef=BB%2FL013762%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/L013762/1","98127138-4776-478E-88F5-FD56564B3A54","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","7C78D0B9-0903-404D-80BC-3BF338368152"

Not only did the Open Planning project develop an innovative app for new perspectives on engaging with the urban planning process, it caused significant shifts in the business practices of Red Ninja and their approach to collaborative work. Lee Omar, the CEO, describes the impact on the company as follows: Having direct access to work with a local authority in a paid capacity gave us confidence and credibility, which enabled us to design and develop a solution that enables more visibility for citizens living in urban environments. The Creative Exchange process was fantastic for us as we invested much more of our own time into the project to enable us to produce IP that we could commercialise. The learning of working with the city data sets as part of the Creative Exchange has enabled us to design and develop commercial products with a multinational energy company on a smart energy platform that will enable sustainable urban developments. Commercially this was valuable to us and is worth ten times the financial reward than the Creative Exchange project. This validates the extra work we did on the Creative Exchange project. Since engaging with Creative Exchange, Red Ninja employs five times as many staff and their turnover has increased six fold. The company is also continuing the collaborative approach to work, sponsoring a programme of PhD students embedded within their practices and developing their own research arm. Additionally, as a direct result of things learned from the Open Planning project, Creative Exchange is funding a new twelve-month collaboration to develop a new platform by which public data (such as that held by city councils) can be held and provided back to relevant parties in a way that can be truly open and beneficial. It will involve working with current data handling companies to develop a new system, with the aim of scaling it across the country. It will initially be trialled in three cities: Manchester, Lancaster and Liverpool.","http://www.redninja.co.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=57305c51a1a145.73099249&grantRef=AH%2FJ005150%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=AH/J005150/1","8D6A32E4-3CED-4B0D-A347-3519BD1B3376","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","C8DB7FEF-A19A-4B3A-BCFA-CCD37A2B2445"

Our product can validate a user's identity by analysing the appearance and movement of their lips as they speak into a camera. These movements are known as their viseme profile and have been shown to be highly speaker-specific. The user is challenged to say a randomly chosen word or phrase each time they are authenticated. This allows our technology to not only accurately verify identity but also ensure that the person is actually present (&quot;liveness&quot;) and therefore the biometric data is not being falsified. Liopa enables a number of use cases including -
 o Prevention of theft and fraud in online and mobile commerce 
 o Online and mobile banking authentication
 o Secure Access to Web-sites

PUFs generate unique outputs that are dependent on the device they are running on. PUFs can be used as a lightweight trust anchor for chips. A spinout from Queen's Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) has been working with PUF technology to develop something extraordinary. Sirona Technologies was founded at the end of 2015 by a trio of researchers Neil Hanley, Maire O'Neill, and Chongyan Gu. They've invented a tiny semiconductor IP core that provides strong, unique authentication for even the cheapest microchip. It means that any grade of device can have the highest grade of security.
By 2020 the Internet of Things is projected to consist of 50 billion connected devices, and the slew of data generated by smart devices and sensors is increasingly processed without human interaction. Widespread machine-to-machine (M2M) communications require trust between the underlying hardware devices, to ensure safety and security. Counterfeiting and refurbishing of electronic parts globally is a widespread problem, and the market to prevent it reaches in the billions. In 2020 the Internet of Things will be a $1.2 trillion market.","2016","PicoPUF (aka Sirona Technologies Ltd), a CSIT spinout new venture, has been awarded NISPConnect's prestigious INVENT Award grand prize.

The company was created by Index Ventures in partnership with the University of Cambridge. 

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects 1 in 2,000 people of European descent. The most common disease-causing mutation is the Z-variant. Z alpha-1-antitrypsin is fully functional when secreted, but most of the protein misfolds and accumulates in liver cells as polymers. People suffering from alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency can present either early in life or late in life with liver cirrhosis. However, the most common manifestation of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is emphysema, generally diagnosed in midlife. Current treatments are limited to lung or liver transplantation and augmentation therapy, whereby protein purified from normal blood is repeatedly administered via weekly intravenous infusions. 

Z Factor is exploiting insight into the structure of the Z-variant of alpha-1-antitrypsin derived from research conducted in the laboratory of Professor Jim Huntington at the University of Cambridge. Z Factor is therefore uniquely placed to design and develop novel therapeutic agents to correct the misfolding of the Z variant and to thereby address an important and unmet medical need.","2015","NA","http://zfactor.co.uk/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=56e00cb7790979.31790262&grantRef=MR%2FL017431%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MR/L017431/1","6AFD37A1-791A-4313-B40B-545F681E301F","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","29E28B0A-0B19-4075-B4EE-C67C6844C753"

Drawing on pioneering work at MRC LMB and MRC NIMR, it has developed novel stabilisation technology (StaRTM) to render these and other difficult drug targets susceptible to structural analysis by X-ray crystallography and complementary biophysical methods. They can also be used as antigens for the development of therapeutic antibodies. In February 2015, Heptares became a fully-owned subsidiary of Sosei Group Corporation.

 www.heptares.com","2007","The structure of a beta1 adrenergic receptor was solved by X-ray crystallography in 2008 using this approach. In 2011, structures of the A2A adenosine receptor both complexed with antagonists, and, for the first time for any GPCR, with the endogenous agonist were also solved, the latter by my ex post-doc, Guillaume Lebon. Arising from the A2A work, a best-in-class selective antagonist has been developed that has been licensed to Shire pharmaceuticals. StarTM technology has so far proved to be generically applicable to GPCRs, and is causing much excitement within the pharmaceutical industry and the wider GPCR community. More than 7 other GPCRs are in the StaR pipeline. Successful applications of StarTM technology in 2012-2015 have included the Orexin-1 receptor, the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor complexed with novel selective agonists, the corticotrophin releasing factor 1 receptor and the transmembrane domain of the mGluR5 receptor. Heptares scientists have confirmed the novel mode of interaction of selective agonists of the M1 muscarinic receptor first proposed as a result of work in my laboratory. These structures are feeding into the development of novel drug candidates directed at these and related receptors for a number of important clinical situations including type 2 diabetes, migraine, addiction and compulsive disorders, chronic insomnia, anxiety and depression, autism and cognitive enhancement. In February 2016, Heptares reported a successful phase 1b clinical trial of a first-in-class selective M1 mAChR agonist designed to enhance cognition in dementia and schizophrenia, devoid of parasympathetic side effects.

"MRC","MC_PC_13034","Research Grant","Spin Outs","Imperial College London",,"Rueckert","Daniel","","IXICO","IXICO was co-founded by Professor Rueckert in 2004. IXICO's innovative technologies help those involved in researching and treating serious diseases to make rapid decisions and improve patient outcomes. Its clinical focus is predominantly dementia, but IXICO also support clinical studies for other disease areas in the field of neuro-degeneration and beyond.

IXICO works with many of the leading pharmaceutical companies providing clinical trial services and technology to evaluate imaging endpoints as part of their drug development pipelines. Its medical image management and analysis products are used by the global pharmaceutical industry to select patients for clinical trials and to assess the safety and efficacy of drugs in development.","2004","Economic impacts IXICO had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry where medical imaging is rapidly becoming an important tool in clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs using imaging biomarkers. IXICO's imaging biomarkers provide several benefits to pharmaceutical companies: In concept trials of AD therapies the developed biomarkers allow pharmaceutical companies to power their studies with fewer subjects. The developed imaging biomarkers do provide evidence of efficacy with around 100 subjects per arm (an arm in a clinical trial refers to any of the treatment groups in a randomized trial. Most randomized trials have two arms, e.g. untreated vs. treated groups) over 12 months rather than 400 or so per arm needed for cognitive testing. Based on a conservative cost estimate of $30k per subject enrolled, this provides a significant cost saving for the companies. Similarly, pharmaceutical companies use the developed imaging biomarkers to enrich their clinical trials. In the context of clinical trials, such enrichment allows the identification of a population of patients in whom a drug effect, if present, is more likely to be demonstrable. In AD trials that use the developed biomarkers, an increase in the conversion rate in a prodromal Alzheimer's trial from 40% to 60% saves 30% off the cost of a pair of pivotal trials that used progression free survival as an endpoint, and which might otherwise cost $800m - $1bn. Impacts on public policy and services The imaging biomarkers developed in the underpinning research have had a significant impact on informing the development of new guidelines for the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and low hippocampal volume in regulatory clinical trials: It now seems likely that to modify the course of Alzheimer's Disease, it is necessary to start the treatment in the pre-dementia (or prodromal) phase. The identification of patients at this stage can only be done confidently with the help of biomarkers: imaging provides a non-invasive alternative to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for this purpose. The critical importance of imaging biomarkers in AD trials has been recognised by the CAMD consortium by submitting to regulators an application to qualify low hippocampal volume as a biomarker. This submission - approved by EMA and currently under review by the FDA - incorporates key data obtained using the underpinning research described here: the availability of this technology, with the regulatory qualification, is having global impact on the design of future trials of AD medicines in the pre-dementia population. In particular, the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has issued a positive opinion on the use of MRI to measure hippocampal volume as a tool to enrich recruitment into regulated clinical trials in the pre-dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease, in which the EMA directly refers to IXICO's technology. This was the first imaging-based biomarker to be qualified by a regulatory agency. Impacts on healthcare The imaging biomarkers developed in the underpinning research have been so effective in clinical trials that IXICO has recently decided also to develop products for diagnostic use (Brain Health Centre). IXICO's product for diagnostics directly uses the methods described in reference of the underpinning research and has also been CE marked. It is currently undergoing trials involving 200 patients as part of new NHS brain health centres.","http://www.ixico.com","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=546120d6292d26.94941786&grantRef=MC_PC_13034","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_PC_13034","1732801D-717E-47D2-9669-740766B49510","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","DC72772A-60E1-4295-8D44-47F448452680"

I could appreciate good design but - in the other start-ups I worked on before, they didn't invest in design as it was seen as a luxury, something that was nice to have but that you didn't need to have. I now realise that it's a must-have! At the beginning, we just wanted to get to market as quickly and cheaply as possible and the packaging wasn't right and hadn't been tested enough. We had a very short window to fix it - people were waiting for their beer and starting to get angry - and the designers in the team got to work testing various alternatives and doing drop tests. There were a few different boxes and we eventually found one that worked. The design process is a collective responsibility and is evident in the team - all input is welcome and there is no one decision maker. It is very much influenced by design methodologies and co-creation.","http://www.beer52.com","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=5739e8175a9271.87986881&grantRef=AH%2FJ005126%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=AH/J005126/1","294A367A-0B69-4B00-B97D-B34451E09DEA","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","90051600-6EF2-4093-BA8C-2B4B6F550895","AE1274F7-E22A-45BD-BA63-91189F0ED6D1"

It has developed a novel fabrication technology for smart capsules that possess customisable properties to suit the needs of a variety of industries. The Aqdot technology greatly simplifies the encapsulation process by utilising the novel one-step, shrink-wrap approach based on a combination of emulsion technology and supramolecular chemistry, whose scientific value has been recognised by Science and Nature Chemistry, and its commercial value recognised by Chemical and Engineering News and The Food Navigator. Using Aqdot's innovative platform technology, a variety of functionalities can be easily incorporated into the capsules, including a number of on-demand release properties that are missing in many state-of-the-art techniques. This cutting edge platform provides a one-pot, single-step process which rapidly produces capsules in minutes versus days.","2012","Aqdot's technology provides the following core benefits in comparison to encapsulation solutions currently on the market: the ease of cargo loading means lower cost of production; all production takes place at room temperature in aqueous solutions, with mild conditions allowing for the encapsulation of the broadest range of cargoes; the payload per capsule or particle is significantly higher than current solutions, considerably reducing the cost and waste of non-cargo materials; a wide range of release triggers are available, each offering potential sensitivities superior to the current state of the art, without compromising microcapsule stability; the functionality of the encapsulation material can be&nbsp;readily customised based on customers' specific cargo and release requirements and the exterior of the capsules or particles can be modified such that the delivery of the capsules or particles can be specifically targeted. Microencapsulation as a technology today refers to a very wide range of technologies that encapsulate, protect and release actives when needed. According to Global Industry Analysts, the overall microencapsulation market is very large, approaching $40 billion in 2015),&nbsp;ranging a number of industries from consumer product goods (household good, food, cosmetics), industrials (oil & gas, pulp & paper), and to pharmaceuticals. Aqdot's novel platform technology has the potential of accessing all of these markets.","http://www.aqdot.com","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=5448e251a21983.12223982&grantRef=EP%2FH046593%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/H046593/1","B67A2A60-B24A-4E44-AAAB-DDC894E6570A","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","52235549-4546-46B7-8FE3-B73146F5AD3D"

Technicam Limited, a British company, was established in 2000 by a group of neurosurgeons and Centrax Limited of Newton Abbot, a precision engineering company.

The aim of the company is the development of innovative advances in the field of surgical devices.

All Technicam products are patent protected and CE marked. The Technicam Cranial Access Device has received an award as a Millenium Product for innovation

The indications for skull burr-holes include insertion of intra-cranial bolts, insertion of exterior ventricular drains(ventriculostomies) , insertion of ventricular catheters for shunts , drainage of chronic subdural haematomas and access for brain biopsies. Burr-holes have been traditionally performed either by using air-powered drills or by hand using a brace, perforator and spherical burr. Recently the demand for cranial access via burr-holes has increased due to the application of monitoring probes, (intra-cranial) pressure transducers, oxygen and multi-parameter sensors and micro-dialysis catheters, and the increasing use of external ventricular drains in patients with head injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Traditionally, burr-holes have been performed in the operating theatre. By undertaking them on the intensive care unit, however, the complications of transferring the patient to the operating theatre can be avoided.","","Technicam have therefore developed a new cranial access system designed to simplify burr-holes, and facilitate the insertion of monitoring probes and external ventricular drains for use in the intensive care unit or the operating theatre - the Technicam Cranial Access System.","http://www.technicam.co.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=EXfTyZa92GG&grantRef=G0600986","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0600986","403421A0-CC02-41AF-BE21-3A423AF2BD3C","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","9D0C5F6D-E2EC-402A-B26D-EF21A234A490"

The group develops a variety of peptide-based systems operating in the rapidly emerging field of 'bio-inspired, molecular self-assembly'. 

Biogelx brings to the market new tools to cell biologists, who need to replicate the behaviour of mammalian cells in the artificial environment of the laboratory. The company develops and supplies highly tuneable, cell-matched peptide hydrogels, capable of revolutionising the way cell biologists control and manipulate cell behaviour in laboratory-based cell culture applications. 

The company started by offering consumable research tools to cell biologists based on patent covering a new type of peptide based gel ('Hydrogel composisitions'). Over the last 3 years, company has grown significantly.","2012","In producing simple mimics of complex biological materials, Professor Rein Ulijn of the University of Strathclyde has developed an international reputation as a leading academic researcher in this field. In 2010 he joined forces with Dr. David Lightbody, an experienced start-up/technology commercialisation chemist, and together they sought to bring a new suite of materials, namely peptide hydrogels, to the cell culture research market. Much of the research through to 2012, had been funded by research councils (ERC, Leverhulme Trust, EPSRC grant ). Having identified a clear market opportunity, Rein and David sourced a candidate to undertake the RSE Enterprise fellowship, which would see a full time Strathclyde PhD graduate work with Rein and David to identify key commercial relationships and develop the Biogelx business plan. In late 2012, the Biogelx business secured equity investment from Gabriel Investments Ltd (&pound; 20k), Scottish Investment Bank (&pound; 20k) and the University of Strathclyde (&pound; 20k) and secured a license arrangement with the University of Strathclyde for the exclusive use of its peptide gel technology. This allowed Biogelx to secure commercial premises at BioCity Scotland and recruit four full time employees. Since trading started in early 2013, Biogelx has successfully developed revolutionary, patented cell-matched hydrogel products that are already generating steady sales income from customers in the UK, mainland Europe, South Korea and the United States. The unique cell-matching capabilities of the company's products clearly provide academic users, medical researchers and major pharmaceutical companies with a serious alternative to competing complex, animal- derived 3D cell culture products. In-house R & D has already generated one new patent application, with a second to follow in early 2016. In June 2015, the Company secured series A investment of &pound;630,000. These funds are being used to grow the operational base of the business and increase the company's profile/customer base internationally. The business now has 10 employees at its base at BioCity Scotland and has recently appointed its first employee at its US subsidiary, Biogelx, Inc., which is located at Harlem Biospace, a New York City life science incubator. To date, Biogelx has successful generated sales of &pound;180k in 2013, &pound;210k in 2014, and approx. &pound;240k in 2015 and has a commercial product range, that is sold to around 40 customers spread across EU, USA, Asia and South America. These include major pharmaceutical companies such as GSK and Novartis, together with some of the UK's leading Universities (UCL, Manchester, Liverpool, Keele).

Electrolysis for hydrogen generation is increasingly being recognized as a key enabling technology for the supply of high purity hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles, energy systems and industrial applications.

Within these contexts, hydrogen production via electrolysis enables: 

 Maximising grid integration of renewables.
 Increasing the economic value of renewable assets (energy storage).
 Creation of a low zero carbon fuel to decarbonize transport, heat and industrial applications (CO2 reduction value).
 Economic application of ultrapure hydrogen in industrial and laboratory applications.

Current electrolytic hydrogen generation systems remain high cost, are not easily coupled to renewable sources and their cost reduction routes other than via economies of scale are limited.

The technology Astrea will exploit was developed by a team led by Professor Lee Cronin of the School of Chemistry at the University Of Glasgow. Scottish Enterprise, Scotland's economic development agency, have funded the project since 2013.

The technology has resulted in a patented system that has both cost and performance advantages over current current electrolyser and hydrogen storage systems including: increased durability, increased efficiency, low cost high pressure and high purity capability, reduced precious metal usage and low load capability for maximizing solar/wind capture and as a consequence delivers a lower cost of ownership to the end user.","2015","just started",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=56e04b69015622.91177243&grantRef=EP%2FK023004%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/K023004/1","5B21CCB2-9DDC-4F86-9FDF-6D5891BA2C3D","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","AE58F21F-3622-4382-97BB-1359BD183E9F","1182919C-A9E8-42DE-87F5-0D5206F8294D"

PUFs generate unique outputs that are dependent on the device they are running on. PUFs can be used as a lightweight trust anchor for chips. A spinout from Queen's Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) has been working with PUF technology to develop something extraordinary. Sirona Technologies was founded at the end of 2015 by a trio of researchers Neil Hanley, Maire O'Neill, and Chongyan Gu. They've invented a tiny semiconductor IP core that provides strong, unique authentication for even the cheapest microchip. It means that any grade of device can have the highest grade of security.
By 2020 the Internet of Things is projected to consist of 50 billion connected devices, and the slew of data generated by smart devices and sensors is increasingly processed without human interaction. Widespread machine-to-machine (M2M) communications require trust between the underlying hardware devices, to ensure safety and security. Counterfeiting and refurbishing of electronic parts globally is a widespread problem, and the market to prevent it reaches in the billions.

The aim of the company is the development of innovative advances in the field of surgical devices.

All Technicam products are patent protected and CE marked. The Technicam Cranial Access Device has received an award as a Millenium Product for innovatio","","The indications for skull burr-holes include insertion of intra-cranial bolts, insertion of exterior ventricular drains(ventriculostomies) , insertion of ventricular catheters for shunts , drainage of chronic subdural haematomas and access for brain biopsies. Burr-holes have been traditionally performed either by using air-powered drills or by hand using a brace, perforator and spherical burr. Recently the demand for cranial access via burr-holes has increased due to the application of monitoring probes, (intra-cranial) pressure transducers, oxygen and multi-parameter sensors and micro-dialysis catheters, and the increasing use of external ventricular drains in patients with head injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Traditionally, burr-holes have been performed in the operating theatre. By undertaking them on the intensive care unit, however, the complications of transferring the patient to the operating theatre can be avoided. Technicam have therefore developed a new cranial access system designed to simplify burr-holes, and facilitate the insertion of monitoring probes and external ventricular drains for use in the intensive care unit or the operating theatre - the Technicam Cranial Access System.","http://www.technicam.co.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=jka6m84gD9Q&grantRef=G0001237","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0001237","CF0B5196-4656-442B-A180-D2E75EE2F82B","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","B7296B44-D98A-4E67-8053-E7E99D157D05"

The company also supplies research-based services to technical markets around the world. The majority of Ossila's sales are through the company website. The company sells a range of laboratory consumable items, electronics and other testing equipment to researchers working in organic electronics. In 75% of cases, the products supplied by Ossila are designed in-house, with the company playing a direct role in their manufacture. 
Ossila also sells a range of organic semiconductor materials that each come with a full-process recipe that allows the user to fabricate high-efficiency OPV/OLED devices. Ossila commissions the synthesis of many of the organic semiconductors that it sells. Other materials are produced by partner companies and are then re-sold by Ossila; however, considerable value is added through testing material performance, performing quality control and developing processing protocols that are supplied to customers.","2009","The impact of the company can be judged in terms of the income generated and the jobs created. Ossila provides a catalogue of materials, components and consumable items to researchers working on the development of organic electronic devices, and mainly exports its products to foreign markets (40 countries in total, worldwide). The breakdown of sales per area in 2012 were: UK 15%, EU 36%, US 8%, rest of world 41% (including India, China, Brazil, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia). Ossila also undertakes contract research projects for other companies and has helped such companies to apply for further funding.

The idea is that helmets of the future will be made-to-measure using 3D scans of the customer's head, and then printed to order. The technology James is developing is based on lightweight honeycomb structures developed for the aerospace industry. These are strong, stiff, and light but can easily crumple to absorb impact forces. By 3D printing these structures, not only does the helmet become tailored to the user, but it can be customised for them too, allowing them to optimise comfort, weight, breathability, and most crucially the protection against different impact modes.","2014","Cycle head injuries typically involve not just direct forces to the skull but also rotational forces too. These rotational forces can cause severe brain bruising and permanent damage, but are not mitigated against in current EPS bicycle helmets. James' design allows for rotational elements within the helmet honeycomb mechanism to be incorporated to absorb these rotational forces. Such mechanisms are expensive to incorporate in normal bicycle helmets (eg. MIPS), but with 3D printing this complexity comes for free. James' prototypes attracted attention from the venture capital world; he found a business partner, and with help from UCL Advances he has started a company called Bentham 3D and has won a UCL Bright Ideas Award of &pound;15,000 to develop the business.","http://www.bentham3d.co.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=5463b241730a34.00102528&grantRef=EP%2FI00159X%2F2","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I00159X/2","F6BF228F-B370-4749-BFB1-E58668774EAE","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","CB6F8EB4-B088-4D31-BEF8-C43E13188DF7"

Mango Tree implements the project studied by the University of Illinois in this RCT. Mango Tree developed a mother tongue literacy program for Primary 1-Primary 3 (P1-P3) pupils. In 2009, it received funding to implement its model in 8 government schools in northern Uganda, later expanding to 11 schools in 2011. In 2013, only having the budget to implement the full program in 12 schools, Mango Tree partnered with researchers to conduct a small RCT with an additional 26 comparison schools. After one year, the effects on letter recognition were over 8 times larger than other randomized trials in low-income countries. In 2014, the evaluation was scaled to 158 schools, funded until 2016.","","Based upon these results, Mango Tree has reshaped its education portfolio and agenda, evolving its works over time to continue asking questions about what makes an effective teacher and a successful education system in Africa. Other organizations have come to Mango Tree seeking similar advice, hiring the company's experts to develop additional literacy programs for primary and secondary schools across the country. This experience has caused Mango Tree to reflect heavily on its work and redesign its education strategy to focus on new areas of classroom instruction and teacher effectiveness that heavily shape the literacy outcomes of students in rural, under-resourced African settings.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=56e1ae93963713.93284285&grantRef=ES%2FM004996%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=ES/M004996/1","B337CBDB-DC44-437B-9CAF-2BEA5A95AD3E","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","B16D710A-5C40-44CA-A796-B37EC8935E99","2988323E-FE99-44AE-AF47-36AB1F1F60FB"

Its core technology is based on a novel implementation of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) processing for the preparation of a wide range of encapsulated structures via a clean, efficient, one step route.","2011","Through close collaborations with clinicians at the Whittington Hospital, AtoCap has identified a first potential blockbuster application in the treatment of chronic urinary tract infections (UTI) - a debilitating condition that affects tens of millions of patients each year. Chronic UTIs are particularly prevalent amongst the elderly population, being identified as a major cause of incontinence, mental confusion and balance problems leading to falls and potentially fatal septicaemea and bladder cancer. Antibiotics are hampered by the difficulty of achieving sufficient localized urinary bactericidal concentrations, while high-dose systemic treatments are toxic and ill-tolerated. Thus, there is a great need for improved delivery systems to achieve the high concentrations of antibiotics needed to counter chronic infection in a localised manner. This will eliminate the significant drawbacks associated with the current oral and intravenous administration methods, specifically poor compliance with regular dosing regimens, poor uptake and side effects such as nausea, compromised immunity as well a build up of resistance over long treatment periods. There is currently no alternative to oral/intravenous administration of antibiotics and thus the potential market is substantial. Over the past year research has continued to optimize the generation of multilayered micro and nanocapsules for the encapsulation and controlled release of antibiotics. These results have provided key supporting data for the primary patent application and been published in leading academic journals. The research has been featured as the cover article in both the Journal of the Royal Society Interface and Macromolecular Rapid Communications.",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=5460c264905556.14526731&grantRef=EP%2FF031122%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/F031122/1","FED58D04-A3B1-4172-9119-4E11CC26568A","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","114344EB-F4C9-432D-93A1-69A1117BF4E9"

Our product can validate a user's identity by analysing the appearance and movement of their lips as they speak into a camera. These movements are known as their viseme profile and have been shown to be highly speaker-specific. The user is challenged to say a randomly chosen word or phrase each time they are authenticated. This allows our technology to not only accurately verify identity but also ensure that the person is actually present (&quot;liveness&quot;) and therefore the biometric data is not being falsified. Liopa enables a number of use cases including -
 o Prevention of theft and fraud in online and mobile commerce 
 o Online and mobile banking authentication
 o Secure Access to Web-sites
 o Physical Access Security, Time and Attendance Management
 o Securing access to Mobile Devices &amp; Applications
 o Authentication for Corporate mobile workforce","2015","Liopa has been named the winner of the Software and Digital Media category, sponsored by Intel, at the 25k Awards.

The Acoustic-Flow technology utilises the interaction of Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) with a patient sample to drive a diagnostic test. The interactions are controlled by
microstructures patterned on the surface of disposable chips, to shape sound in particular ways in a frequency dependant manner. Functions possible include fluid movement, mixing, particle patterning, enrichment, opening cells to release DNA and temperature cycling of a sample. Acoustic-Flow technology means that samples can be processed on-chip (no preprocessing required) and complex micro-fluidics are avoided.
 
The SAW Dx business model is based on providing product and technology solutions to life sciences and diagnostics companies seeking to enhance their diagnostic product offerings through innovative point of care use.

Together they looked at how to design empathy and community into an open hardware product development life cycle. The central concern and motivator for the project and its research approach was civic wellbeing, bringing a new angle to the timely topic of wearable devices and open data, including demographics outside the usual young technology aware user base. There is a lot of data that is about individuals but not a lot of data that is for individuals and their communities. Numbers that Matter aimed to design more meaningful ways of accessing and building with that data - not limited to designing for the tech elite of early adopters and instead responding to the day-to-day needs and concerns of a locality. The Numbers That Matter project held a Hackathon in March 2014. The winner of this hackathon, with financial and business development support from The Creative Exchange, went on to found a startup company Made With Glove developing heated glove wearable devices, and was shortlisted for The Pitch top 100, Britain's biggest small business competition. http://www.thepitch.uk/shortlist/made-withglove-ltd/220. After receiving a &pound;5,000 innovation voucher from Innovate UK to conduct prefeasibility studies, the company founder Michelle Hua is now applying for the SMART funding through Innovate UK and hopes to launch a commercial product during 2016. Creative Exchange have been very supportive in progressing my idea to prototype stage. While the funding itself was to bring an idea to prototype stage, I have received more than a prototype which has added great value to my business. The value, I believe, has been in making the right connections and meeting the right people to support my business. This is so important in every entrepreneur's journey. I was invited to attend and exhibit my prototype at the Prime Conference at the Royal Institution of Great Britain. I was inspired by all the speakers and made valuable connections with people from the industry. I was also invited to attend the AHRC and Innovate UK meeting in London to discuss ways in which AHRC and Innovate UK can have better relationships and how Innovate UK can better service its customers. We also addressed the challenges of small and micro businesses' access to Innovate UK. Being a startup entrepreneur, it was very interesting learning about the issues of funding from the funder's perspective. I was invited to showcase my prototype at the Innovate UK exhibition at Old Billingsgate in London with over 2000 international delegates, providing me with many opportunities for my business. The support along the way from the team has been invaluable, answering questions in relation to funding, business ideas, models and introducing me to networks of contacts as well as discussing and brainstorming ideas.

The money came from STFC as part of their Industry Programme Support Scheme (PIPPS) scheme.

The model the company uses to trade is to predetermine the size of a buy or sell order but let the programme decide how to execute the order, i.e. when is the best time and what size of individual orders to use. There are two main factors which influence the usefulness of this type of trading, the algorithms used and execution time for these algorithms. Having previously developed the algorithms Econophysica wanted to getting the models crunched on the Grid to speed up execution time.

Technicam Limited, a British company, was established in 2000 by a group of neurosurgeons and Centrax Limited of Newton Abbot, a precision engineering company.

The aim of the company is the development of innovative advances in the field of surgical devices.

All Technicam products are patent protected and CE marked. The Technicam Cranial Access Device has received an award as a Millenium Product for innovation

The indications for skull burr-holes include insertion of intra-cranial bolts, insertion of exterior ventricular drains(ventriculostomies) , insertion of ventricular catheters for shunts , drainage of chronic subdural haematomas and access for brain biopsies. Burr-holes have been traditionally performed either by using air-powered drills or by hand using a brace, perforator and spherical burr. Recently the demand for cranial access via burr-holes has increased due to the application of monitoring probes, (intra-cranial) pressure transducers, oxygen and multi-parameter sensors and micro-dialysis catheters, and the increasing use of external ventricular drains in patients with head injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Traditionally, burr-holes have been performed in the operating theatre. By undertaking them on the intensive care unit, however, the complications of transferring the patient to the operating theatre can be avoided.","","Technicam have therefore developed a new cranial access system designed to simplify burr-holes, and facilitate the insertion of monitoring probes and external ventricular drains for use in the intensive care unit or the operating theatre - the Technicam Cranial Access System.","http://www.technicam.co.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=EXfTyZa92GG&grantRef=G9439390","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G9439390","0DB6ECB0-5821-4DB8-8BC3-2DCCF1258AEF","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","B7296B44-D98A-4E67-8053-E7E99D157D05"

Personally-controlled medical record platforms will contribute to restore our personal responsibility towards healthy living, reduce healthcare costs and improve transparency and accountability, whilst helping to break information and knowledge silos.
Given that citizens are becoming active co-producers of healthcare information, open, inter-operable and scalable information platforms linking citizens, carers, and professional, can provide a new channel for enabling self-care.
With a growing wellbeing market and the emergence of on-line personal health records, healthcare information is starting to accumulate at much earlier stages. This creates an opportunity to reach up stream in health promotion and preventive activities.
Relying on intelligent data services and open data standards, and enabled by opening the garden-wall approach of current personally-controlled medical record platforms, independent software application developers would be able to envision new health data services linked to emergent demands from proactive consumers of pre-primary care (health + wellbeing) services. 
A federated approach to data management, enabled by mobile technologies, would allow proactive personal engagement and collective responsibility, and help improve cost-effectiveness of healthcare services.
In addition, gamification of medical applications have the potential to improve compliance and the formation of healthy habits. Intelligent data repositories and services will help not only integrate electronic health information, but also enable evidence-based 'collective' decision making amongst carers and clinical providers and unleash new knowledge and discoveries.","2013",".

Swansea Innovations has developed an integrated Mass Spectroscopy (MS) platform for the quantitative and structural determination of cholesterol metabolites in biological systems. The Liquid Chromatography (LC) MS technology utilises quantitative charged tags that allows for the identification of steroid molecules. The technology is substantially more sensitive than existing methodologies with a capacity to quantify a greater number of steroids.
The Science
The research group at Swansea Innovations have established that endogenous acidic cholesterol metabolites can have a neuroprotective and a neurotoxic effect on motor neurons. 
The Market
Swansea inventors have focussed on the medical opportunities for this technology as they have identified acidic cholesterol metabolites with neuroprotective activity and also abnormal cholesterol metabolite levels in a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an inherited disease in which affected individuals cannot make the normal profile of bile acids. As children grow older they may present with a range of symptoms including cataracts, abnormal movements, intellectual disability and cholesterol deposits in the brain. In conjunction with the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, Swansea researchers have shown that plasma samples from patients with CTX showed very low levels of all cholestenoic acids. Further, abnormal cholesterol profiles have been identified in the Motor Neuron Disease (MND)- related illness, hereditary spastic paresis. A spin out company CholesteniX has been formed to commercialise the biomarker and therapeutic potential of this technology for MND and other neurodegenerative diseases. Swansea is in discussions with a number of commercial parties who have expressed an interest in this technology. The consensus view now is that most neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease) may be developing for anything up to decades before physical symptoms start to appear. Early diagnosis and treatment in this area may hold out the hope of slowing progression sufficiently to avoid late stage disease, saving the NHS and the economy millions of pounds in treatment and care and benefiting many thousands families with affected individuals.","2013","none as yet",,"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=5696391d8f5c05.47719884&grantRef=BB%2FI001735%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=BB/I001735/1","41404D51-6143-4B2A-9596-CD1074C7F693","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","AB307619-D4FA-427E-A042-09DBEBA84669","E3533D19-36C6-4B5D-BEA8-B92FAEDE8A9D"

Our product can validate a user's identity by analysing the appearance and movement of their lips as they speak into a camera. These movements are known as their viseme profile and have been shown to be highly speaker-specific. The user is challenged to say a randomly chosen word or phrase each time they are authenticated. This allows our technology to not only accurately verify identity but also ensure that the person is actually present (&quot;liveness&quot;) and therefore the biometric data is not being falsified. Liopa enables a number of use cases including -
 o Prevention of theft and fraud in online and mobile commerce 
 o Online and mobile banking authentication
 o Secure Access to Web-sites
 o Physical Access Security, Time and Attendance Management
 o Securing access to Mobile Devices &amp; Applications
 o Authentication for Corporate mobile workforce","2015","Liopa has been named the winner of the Software and Digital Media category, sponsored by Intel, at the 25k Awards.

Personally-controlled medical record platforms will contribute to restore our personal responsibility towards healthy living, reduce healthcare costs and improve transparency and accountability, whilst helping to break information and knowledge silos.
Given that citizens are becoming active co-producers of healthcare information, open, inter-operable and scalable information platforms linking citizens, carers, and professional, can provide a new channel for enabling self-care.
With a growing wellbeing market and the emergence of on-line personal health records, healthcare information is starting to accumulate at much earlier stages. This creates an opportunity to reach up stream in health promotion and preventive activities.
Relying on intelligent data services and open data standards, and enabled by opening the garden-wall approach of current personally-controlled medical record platforms, independent software application developers would be able to envision new health data services linked to emergent demands from proactive consumers of pre-primary care (health + wellbeing) services. 
A federated approach to data management, enabled by mobile technologies, would allow proactive personal engagement and collective responsibility, and help improve cost-effectiveness of healthcare services.
In addition, gamification of medical applications have the potential to improve compliance and the formation of healthy habits. Intelligent data repositories and services will help not only integrate electronic health information, but also enable evidence-based 'collective' decision making amongst carers and clinical providers and unleash new knowledge and discoveries.","2013",".

The project is aimed at translating an academic discovery programme funded by Cancer Research UK and developed by Dr Steven Lee and Prof Roy Bicknell at the University of Birmingham into a commercially viable cell therapy.

The collaborating partners have launched a new company, Chimeric Therapeutics Ltd. This new company will hold all future IP rights to the resultant discoveries.","2015","The project is based on a new generation chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell (CAR-T) immuno-oncology therapy for solid tumours. This involves directing the CAR-T cell towards a new, highly specific marker of tumour angiogenesis, CLEC14a. This therapy will act as a vasculature disruptive agent compromising oxygen supply to the tumours and inhibiting tumour growth. The technology is currently undergoing the final stages of preclinical development, and is planned to enter into clinical trials soon after. The Cell Therapy Catapult will specifically be involved in the project to accelerate the translation of the academic discoveries made in Birmingham with Cancer Research Technology around CAR-T immunotherapies for solid tumours and the CLEC14a target towards a commercially available cell therapy. Immunotherapy is an exciting area in cancer treatment and this technology could provide a powerful route to harness the power of the immune system to block the development of blood vessels, and stop tumours growing.","http://www.checkcompany.co.uk/company/09842382/CHIMERIC-THERAPEUTICS-LIMITED","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=56df03c7e10872.59728567&grantRef=MC_PC_13057","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=MC_PC_13057","5D1701D1-9283-4BA9-A17F-6A9F7A66A7F8","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","E8EE1BC9-799D-4921-8C12-8689B9552A74"

Chiasma really changed the way I think about design. It changed the way I see myself and our company. The design thinking and process toolkit that you gave to designers [at Rural Economies Chiasma, 'Sustaining Rural Scotland' in Oct 2014] is something that we use for everything now. I think it's something that we did to a certain extent before, not consciously realising it was design thinking, but now we're much more conscious of it and make sure we go through that process much more on a conscious level which puts design as more of a focus on everything that we do. Developing ideas together, around a specific problem, provides an opportunity to come up with solutions together.

The design values were evident, the tools were very well designed and the whole concept well developed. However, without volunteers who were confident, clear and adaptable, the project would never have succeeded. Well done to the whole team. Ewan MacPherson, founder Know Sugar Shop said - I'm fundamentally a design engineer, that's my long-term background. I also enjoyed art at school but in the bad old days I had to give it up to study more science and maths to become an engineer. That was then, I'm sure it's not like that now. In my career I've been shocked at the reactionary attitude we've had towards design often seen as a stick-on, add-on extra. It's not, it's fundamentally part of things. Design in Action opened up to me, which I hadn't really appreciated before, that service design was something to focus on as a discipline. It was a gradual thing but I began to see that it's really, really important.

The company is backed by a &pound;4.5m investment from the Carbon Trust and leading international specialty chemicals company Rhodia.

Eight19, so called as it takes 8 minutes and 19 seconds for light to travel from the sun to the earth, will focus its efforts on developing product prototypes utilising techniques for fabricating large scale plastic electronic devices using roll-to-roll processes developed in the CIKC?s 3PV project. The company will continue to be actively engaged with CIKC and its innovative research output through the CIKC ?3PV+? project.

The company has been created by a partnership of Professor Sir Richard Friend, Professor Henning Sirringhaus and Professor Neil Greenham with technology development company TTP through the Carbon Trust?s Advanced Photovoltaic Research Accelerator.

Solar cells made with semiconducting plastics (also known as organic photovoltaics, or OPV) offer potentially very low cost production enabled by low temperature and high throughput processing typical of plastic films, ease of installation for construction companies and simplified manufacturing integration. The market for organic solar cells has the potential to reach $500 million by 2015 and to grow four fold to $2 billion by 2020 (Nanomarkets, 2009) driven by applications such as building-integrated photovoltaics, and could save up to 900 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050 ? some 1.5 times the UK?s current annual emissions.","2010","In 2012 Eight19 announced the launch of Azuri Technologies Limited to develop its internationally recognised Indigo 'pay-as-you-go' solar technology for off-grid markets. Eight19 will concentrate on development of its printed plastic solar technology and Azuri will focus on expanding the Indigo product family and market reach. In 2012, Eight19 was crowned 'Small Business of the Year' and won the 'Renewable Energy Project of the Year' award at the BusinessGreen Leaders Awards, for its work on the Indigo pay-as-you-go solar system which provides clean and affordable electricity to off-grid rural communities.

Sirona Technologies was founded at the end of 2015 by a trio of researchers Neil Hanley, Maire O'Neill, and Chongyan Gu. They've invented a tiny semiconductor IP core that provides strong, unique authentication for even the cheapest microchip. It means that any grade of device can have the highest grade of security.
By 2020 the Internet of Things is projected to consist of 50 billion connected devices, and the slew of data generated by smart devices and sensors is increasingly processed without human interaction. Widespread machine-to-machine (M2M) communications require trust between the underlying hardware devices, to ensure safety and security. Counterfeiting and refurbishing of electronic parts globally is a widespread problem, and the market to prevent it reaches in the billions. In 2020 the Internet of Things will be a $1.2 trillion market.","2016","PicoPUF (aka Sirona Technologies Ltd), a CSIT spinout new venture, has been awarded NISPConnect's prestigious INVENT Award grand prize.

The PervasID technology is based on a ground-breaking battery-less UHF RFID system that enables customers to monitor their items, both cheaply and effectively, in real-time. The RFID DAS system consists of a centralised RFID DAS controller/reader unit, feeding a number of antennas over co-ax cables. The antennas, which are distributed over the interrogation area are used in a collaborative manner for enhanced tag detection and location, compared with conventional systems. The time required to inventorise a large population of tags is also reduced.

The RFID DAS unit is equipped with an Ethernet interface allowing tag information to be uploaded to a centralised server for processing, analysis and display.","2011","The encouraging results of this grant and the successful collaboration with potential end users in trials have prompted the inventors of the technology to form a spin-out company, PervasID Ltd. The company is wholly owned by the inventors. In 2015 PervasID carried out a large trail with a Blue Chip retail store. The trail involved over 140 systems tracking goods across the entire store (typically over 100k items). This demonstrated that the approach is unrivalled in the market in terms of performance. Further trails which are hoped to lead to a nationwide roll out are on going.","http://www.pervasid.com","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=m-4837402845.581437132eb83c&grantRef=EP%2FI028439%2F1","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=EP/I028439/1","E7CAD17E-484B-4AB0-A64F-0F3048C8D3DF","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","4F7A0A68-CB98-4430-A327-4A039640B25C"

. The Aesthetic of Waste - an investigation of the creative and commercial potential of kiln cast re-cycled mineral waste.
. Design to Manufacture: Realising the creative and commercial potential of a unique aesthetic 'Eco-material'

The company was set up with &pound;260,000 venture capital, secured by commercialisation partners Frontier IP.

The University has Licensed the IP to ALUSID. Currently the company employs 3 permanent staff, including Dr Alasdair Brenmer who is Operations Manager. Professor David Binns is seconded to ALUSID, as Creative and Technical Director.
The company has a board of 3 directors:
Tony Attard OBE - Chairman, Neil Crabb (Representing Frontier IP), Dr John Lonsdale (Representing UCLan).

The Company has now established a fully operational pilot factory in Preston.
Company address: Unit 6, Astra Business Park, Roman Way, Preston PR25AP

The company was launched at the 100% Design International Design Fair at Olympia in London in September 2015.

The University of Central Lancashire has licensed the IP to ALUSID and is currently patenting the new material (SilicaStone), developed through the AHRC funded research and now manufactured by ALUSID.

Technicam Limited, a British company, was established in 2000 by a group of neurosurgeons and Centrax Limited of Newton Abbot, a precision engineering company.

The aim of the company is the development of innovative advances in the field of surgical devices.

All Technicam products are patent protected and CE marked. The Technicam Cranial Access Device has received an award as a Millenium Product for innovatio","","The indications for skull burr-holes include insertion of intra-cranial bolts, insertion of exterior ventricular drains(ventriculostomies) , insertion of ventricular catheters for shunts , drainage of chronic subdural haematomas and access for brain biopsies. Burr-holes have been traditionally performed either by using air-powered drills or by hand using a brace, perforator and spherical burr. Recently the demand for cranial access via burr-holes has increased due to the application of monitoring probes, (intra-cranial) pressure transducers, oxygen and multi-parameter sensors and micro-dialysis catheters, and the increasing use of external ventricular drains in patients with head injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Traditionally, burr-holes have been performed in the operating theatre. By undertaking them on the intensive care unit, however, the complications of transferring the patient to the operating theatre can be avoided. Technicam have therefore developed a new cranial access system designed to simplify burr-holes, and facilitate the insertion of monitoring probes and external ventricular drains for use in the intensive care unit or the operating theatre - the Technicam Cranial Access System.","http://www.technicam.co.uk","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=jka6m84gD9Q&grantRef=G9439390","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G9439390","0DB6ECB0-5821-4DB8-8BC3-2DCCF1258AEF","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","B7296B44-D98A-4E67-8053-E7E99D157D05"

The company was created by Index Ventures in partnership with the University of Cambridge. 

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects 1 in 2,000 people of European descent. The most common disease-causing mutation is the Z-variant. Z alpha-1-antitrypsin is fully functional when secreted, but most of the protein misfolds and accumulates in liver cells as polymers. People suffering from alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency can present either early in life or late in life with liver cirrhosis. However, the most common manifestation of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is emphysema, generally diagnosed in midlife. Current treatments are limited to lung or liver transplantation and augmentation therapy, whereby protein purified from normal blood is repeatedly administered via weekly intravenous infusions. 

Z Factor is exploiting insight into the structure of the Z-variant of alpha-1-antitrypsin derived from research conducted in the laboratory of Professor Jim Huntington at the University of Cambridge. Z Factor is therefore uniquely placed to design and develop novel therapeutic agents to correct the misfolding of the Z variant and to thereby address an important and unmet medical need.","2015","NA","http://zfactor.co.uk/","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=56e00cb7790979.31790262&grantRef=G0801899","http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/projects?ref=G0801899","388D0C66-F2CF-4D62-8DA7-D91309A66E26","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","29E28B0A-0B19-4075-B4EE-C67C6844C753"

However, there is a perceived barrier to their acceptance as often computer simulations are seen as &quot;black-boxes&quot; and are not well understood, and hence trusted, by users: simulations are simply not transparent enough. In response to this, SimOmics has developed a series of tools to support the development, and deployment, of computer-based simulations for preclinical and clinical trials used in the drug discovery process that are transparent and allow you to follow the rationale for the simulation design from wet lab data to in silico results. Our expertise in the response of the immune system to drug intervention and effects on the host, and we have a wealth of expertise in the development of computer simulations of the immune system. Our tools help inform decisions on trial design and predict long-term effects of interventions. SimOmic's tools, when combined with our bespoke computer simulation development service, allows you to eliminate needless and costly trials and to focus on those with the greatest likelihood of success, thus saving time and money. Our integrated toolset provides support for total transparency of the decision making process, so you can make better informed decisions.

It is dedicated to the development of a new generation of compact, low-cost and powerful ultrafast fibre lasers (i.e. lasers that can generate light pulses lasting less than a few picoseconds) for a wide range of scientific and commercial applications. An ultrafast laser employs a component known as a saturable absorber (SA) to generate a train of short-duration and high-peak-power pulses. 

CamLase's patent-protected technology is based on the intriguing optoelectronic properties of carbon nanomaterials, i.e. graphene and carbon nanotubes. Compared with conventional approaches, this breakthrough nanotechnology not only provides a simpler and more cost-effective fabrication method, but at the same time allows ultrashort laser pulses to be generated over a greatly extended spectral range (i.e. wavelength beyond 1.5 _m), therefore greatly expands the market opportunity for ultrafast lasers.

The research behind CamLase spin-off was supported through a CIKC Small Grant (Nanolase). The company co-founder Dr Frank Wang was funded by CIKC to attend entrepreneurship (Ignite) and business skills courses (Technology and Innovation Management 2009) to help him develop the business plan for the spin-off.
