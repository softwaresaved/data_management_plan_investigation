# Investigation of Data Management Plans and their use in research funded by RCUK

## Summary

This investigation will look into data-related research outcomes and data management plans (DMPs), with the ultimate aim of understanding whether DMPs have been effective at changing research practices.

It's difficult at this stage to predict where this analysis will go. However, the general thrust is that we are interested in how well data management plans are being constructed, whether they are being complied with, and whether they are changing academic culture in relation to data.

The first step is to investigate data-related outcomes on Researchfish. This gives us a baseline to work from. The next step is to review DMPs to get an understanding of how they are being written, and whether there is useful data that can be extracted. We'll do this via a dipstick method: selecting maybe 100 DMPs or so, possibly from two different years. Once we have that assessment, we can start to think about how a more useful analysis could be conducted. We could increase our hit rate by starting with DMPs that relate to a technical call that is likely to produce data.

In a perfect world, we would then OCR all the data management plans, run some text mining algorithm to illuminate key points we'd identified from the preliminary analysis and then publish the results to wide acclaim. We're unlikely to live in that world, but I feel that something useful could be extracted. Even just showing an improvement in the writing of DMPs from 2012 to 2016 would be important. That could be as simple as showing that they are longer and tend to include more data-related words (the prevalence of the term "DOI" would be interesting).

Compliance to the DMP might be difficult to measure, but there is the possibility that we could show a rough percentage of how many DMPs have promised a data-related outcome, but have not registered one in Researchfish. We probably don't want to name-and-shame, because these people are at least putting information into their DMPs. There's also a question over whether people are recording data in the right outcome categories. This might become clearer once we've investigated the outcomes, published some results and received some feedback from the community.

## Plan

The keyword for this project will be 'Agile'. We know the general direction, but our route will be unknown until we investigate the data and see what is, and is not, possible. The basic stages are:

1. Get all data related research outcomes from Gateway to Research.
1. Analyse research outcomes and look for trends or peculiarities.
1. Investigate whether DMPs can be converted to searchable text
1. Perform projects to understand affect of DMPs on research
